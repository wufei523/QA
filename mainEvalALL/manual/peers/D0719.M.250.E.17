
France and especially West Germany also had a history of keeping unemployment low in the 1960s and early 1970s But in 1975, West German unemployment more than doubled to 3.4 percent. While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates. The 12.5 percent unemployment rate is haunting the Christmas season in France as militants and unionists staged several protests over the past week against unemployment. The unemployment rate in France dropped by 0.3 percent to stand at 12.4 percent in November, said the Ministry of Employment, in December 1997. The French government, in January 1998, announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84 million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package. Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in southern France and in one Parisian suburb, in December 1998, keeping pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs (dlrs 535). Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country. At the end of June, the country's unemployment rate is 11.3 percent. The unemployment rate of France stood at 10.6 percent at the end of December, the lowest in seven years.
