The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet. Something else that's troubling the music industry: Sometimes, Napster users get hold of material that hasn't been released. Napster also has been sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in federal court in San Francisco. The trade group, which represents major recording labels, alleged copyright infringement by Napster and is seeking $100000 for each song. The Napster software program allows Internet users to search for and download music directly from each others'computer hard drives. Small recording labels and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and downloadable music to gain market share. Internet swapping of free music files has cut into music sales. A federal judge was ordering Napster Inc to shut down its Web site that has spawned millions of music trades on the Internet. The MP3.com plan violated the recording industry's many copyright protections. Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music. Napster has built a business by encouraging individual users to share files of music. Napster is also fighting similar suits by rap artist Dr Dre and the Recording Industry Association of America. The established entertainment industries deal with the increasing problem of Internet users using file-sharing programs like Napster. The Napster music-community site remains off-limits to students.
