Israel's deep waters appear to be very promising, said the government's Director of Petroleum Research. 
Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years. 
Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited. 
Shell will carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Cote d'Ivoire. 
Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data. 
Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years. 
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed. 
It was the first time explorers have looked for archaeological ruins in deep water, partly thanks to newly developed technology. 
Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica. 
The scientists plan to make images of the cracks with sonar waves, and take deep samples of the seabed to see if the cracks are fresh or covered with layers of sediment.
