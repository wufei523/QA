Peru is the world's 12th biggest gold producer and second in South America after Brazil. The increase in gold production, which put Mexico in the 17th place worldwide, was due to an increase in demand for exports and to the investments that were made during the past two years in the mining industry, mainly in the north of the country. Venezuela is expected to attract between 1999 and 2003 44 billion US dollars in private capital to boost the mining of gold, coal, iron, nickel and bauxite. This year Peru's mining companies planned to invest over 350 million US dollars to increase gold production. Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels in the wilderness. They also want officials to overturn last year's mining and logging decree, grant them title to what they say are millions of acres of their ancestral lands and recognize their right to decide the future of the region. Environmentalists and Indians say they aren't opposed to all development in the jungles, but the government plan is too much, too fast, and officials won't properly regulate the mining and logging companies.
