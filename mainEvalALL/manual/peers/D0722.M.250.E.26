
 The failure is an apparent setback in the Pentagon's drive to develop a national missile defense system. Republicans argued that a national missile defense system is needed now because of the growing threat of missile attacks on the U.S. targets. U.S. defense authorities are developing a multibillion dollar national missile defense system, but Washington has not approved its deployment. Russia has opposed construction of a U.S. missile defense system, saying it violates the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The administration has said it will not decide on firm plans for an anti-missile system. Franklin said the two successful tests this summer have proven that the missile works. President Clinton has said he will decide whether to build a phased system to protect against several dozen long-range missiles. Boeing will design a system of ground-based interceptor missiles and space-based satellites for missile launch detection and communications. The missile defense program is a $60 billion system that would allow the United States to destroy incoming warheads. The first generation of Patriot missile defense system was widely used in the U.S. Gulf War operations to knock down Iraqi scud missiles soaring into neighboring countries. The scientists based their calculations on nonclassified information describing the complete missile defense system from the Pentagon and other agencies. The test on the Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD system, was done at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico. One failed test led the Pentagon to impose $15 million in penalties against the developer, Lockheed Martin,.
