Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill.  Clinton became the first president to use the power by vetoing a series of small items last August, exercising the veto power 82 times last year, striking 1.9 billion dollars in spending projected over five years.  Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.  The line-item veto, sought by U.S. presidents for more than a century, gives the president the ability to cancel special interest tax breaks as well as specific spending items that he deems wasteful while avoiding killing the entire measure.

Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law -- which gives the president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional balance of powers between the various branches of government.  Supporters of the line-item veto announced they would immediately offer legislation to circumvent the justices' decision by requiring each spending item approved by Congress to be listed as a separate bill for the president's signature or veto.
