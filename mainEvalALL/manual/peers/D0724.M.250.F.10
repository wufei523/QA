The study was to be published's Journal of the American Medical Association, along with other studies on obesity. Arizona has been a focal point of considerable research in the area of obesity and genetics. The index measures the ratio of weight to height.

A common definition of obesity is when a child's weight exceeds 20 percent of ideal weight, based on age, height and frame. While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures. Researchers evaluate overweight and obesity using a measure called body mass index, which divides weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters. Story can end here.

Aim for a healthy weight. They offered several options to prevent obesity. Obesity must be recognized as the serious public health problem. Obesity is a known risk factor for adult-onset diabetes, heart disease, and some types of cancer.
