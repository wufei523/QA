Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world.
In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar, also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours
Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific.
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
It was Auguste Piccard, his grandfather, who in 1931 became the first human to reach the stratosphere, the first to see the earth's curvature firsthand, and the inventor of the pressurized cabin, which opened up the frontier of aviation to regular passenger travel.
It was the invention of the modern Rozier balloon that made the feat possible, by using modern lightweight plastics for the balloon itself and by combining the advantages of the two principal types of balloons : helium and hot air.
