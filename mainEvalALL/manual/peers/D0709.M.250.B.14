The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in "The Hurricane," Hilary Swank for leading actress in "Boys Don't Cry," Michael Caine for supporting actor in "The Cider House Rules," and Jolie for supporting actress. Angelina Jolie's win for best supporting actress for her role in "Girl, Interrupted" came 21 years after father Jon Voight was awarded best actor for "Coming Home." Jolie and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time. "Dad, you're a great actor, but a better father," Jolie said. Gwyneth Paltrow of "Shakespeare In Love" and Michael Caine were honored Sunday for motion picture acting, and Michael J. Fox was a funny but poignant winner for TV comedy actor at the Golden Globes. The awards had once been buffeted by controversy over allegations of corrupt voting and long suffered credibility problems, with the lowlight being the 1981 event that awarded Pia Zadora a statue for the bomb "Butterfly." "Here I am, at an event with the wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and serious." Jolie often obliquely refers to "things" she has gone through and endured in her life with the unspoken understanding that these are things you don't get to know about.
