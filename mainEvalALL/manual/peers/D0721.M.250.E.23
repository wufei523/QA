On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.  Before savagely beating Matthew Shepard with a pistol butt, one of his tormentors taunted him, saying, ``It's Gay Awareness Week.''

Henderson has pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping in the death of Shepard.

Aaron J. McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage'' because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here.  A judge today barred defense lawyers from using a ``gay panic'' defense in the murder trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.

As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the country as has no other single event in recent years.

Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
