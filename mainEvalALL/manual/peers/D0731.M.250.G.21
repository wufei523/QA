 _ Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week, one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday. 	Lewinsky: ``A little bit, but ... for me, the point of that   meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't  returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way  ... to ... cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp  testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never  disclosed that to the president. -- Maryland prosecutors have asked the   federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President  Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of  Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported. 
Tripp turned over the tapes to Independent Counsel Kenneth   Starr, triggering the investigation into the former White House  intern's affair with President Clinton.    Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.    It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.    Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky _ not to mention the accompanying media frenzy _ directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
