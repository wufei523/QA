The prospect that the Breitling's crew, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones, may succeed where all others have failed seemed more promising with each passing hour. 
Only last week a British balloon, the Cable & Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean. 
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight. 
It would be Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. 
Piccard's last round-the-world bid was abandoned after China refused his balloon entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed to speed it over the Pacific. 
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. 
The two men, Piccard and Wim Verstraeten, were rescued by French helicopters in the Mediterranean where their balloon landed because fuel from the heating system had leaked into the cabin. 
Pilots Piccard from Switzerland and Wim Verstraeten from Belgium, plus flight engineer Andy Elson from Britain, departed from Chateau d'Oex, in western Switzerland, aboard Breitling Orbiter II. 
Piccard of Switzerland and Briton Brian Jones climbed out of the hi-tech gondola of the Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon to break off some of the icicles with an ice pick on Thursday.
