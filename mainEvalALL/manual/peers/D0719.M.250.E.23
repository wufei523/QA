While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.  "Despite the 1993 reform of the unemployment insurance system, replacement rates (unemployment compensation rates) have remained relatively high for low income earners."

The French government Saturday announced several emergency measures to support the jobless people, including sending an additional 500 million franc (84 million U.S. dollars) unemployment aid package.  She [Martine Aubry] also promised to continue holding talks with unions and anti-unemployment associations on the terms to be adopted by the government in favor of jobless people.

France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been unemployed for more than a year.

Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.  The jobless protest, which started in the southern port of Marseille, has spread to Aix-en-Provence and Martigues, where activists occupied a total of eight unemployment offices Tuesday morning.

France's unemployment rate dropped by 1.6 percent in December last year, reducing the nation's jobless people to 2,583,600.  Moreover, the number of jobless people dropped by 11.4 percent, or 333,600 people, from December 1998 to December 1999.
