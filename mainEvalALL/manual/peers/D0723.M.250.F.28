
Large fund-raising events are being planned for both San Francisco and Los Angeles early next year.
Feinstein estimated that she will need to raise at least $15 million to defend her seat, and will begin the process with a women's event in San Francisco.
Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology, terrorism and government information.
Trade officials and lobbyists for U.S. drug companies have fought back, pressing Congress to protect intellectual property rights.
Republicans control 55 seats while the Democrats have 45 seats.
In 1992, Democrats chose Texas Gov. Ann Richards to chair their New York convention and in 1984, Gov. Martha Layne Collins of Kentucky was selected as the chair of the convention held in San Francisco.
Feinstein cited the charge that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to file a false affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
In her eight years in Washington, Feinstein, a native Californian and the former mayor of San Francisco, has quietly pushed for anti-crime legislation and issues close to home.
Feinstein is frequently mentioned as a potential running mate for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2000.
Thus far in his very private process of selecting a running mate, Vice President Al Gore has given few hints that he is ready to do just that by selecting a woman for the No.
