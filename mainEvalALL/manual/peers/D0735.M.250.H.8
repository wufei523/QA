The population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction.
A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing "incomprehensible," and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade _ will continue.
The restoration program survives the court challenge, the Northern Rockies wolf population can be removed from protection under the Endangered Species Act when there have been at least 100 wolves and 10 packs in each of the three recovery areas.
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
Under the program, Canadian gray wolves were relocated in Yellowstone and central Idaho and considered an "experimental and nonessential" wolf population, which means they lost much of the protection they would otherwise have under the Endangered Species Act.
The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal "reflects the success of wolf recovery programs," it "falls far short of a bolder
