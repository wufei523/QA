The total includes $13.4 million in state and federal expenses estimated previously, plus the new FBI estimate issued in response media requests. 

The FBI has spent the most money during the intense search of the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, where Rudolph grew up. 

FBI expenses include salaries, benefits, travel, transportation, supplies, services and equipment. However, the agency's estimate spans only from Oct. 1, 1998, through Sept. 30, 1999. 

Authorities began searching for Rudolph on Jan. 29, 1998. That morning, officials charge, he detonated a nail bomb at the New Woman All Women Health Care Clinic in Birmingham that killed an off-duty police officer providing security at the abortion clinic and maimed a nurse. 

Officials say Rudolph disappeared into a part of the dense Appalachians renowned for its hiking and whitewater rafting. A heavily armed task force pursued him to Andrews, N.C., and hunkered down for two years. The command post, a former textile mill leased from the town, cost $5,250 a month. 

When leads cooled earlier this year, the Southeast Bomb Task Force retreated to a token presence and closed the command center. Its lead agent was reassigned to Washington. The last verified sighting of Rudolph was in July 1998 near Andrews.
