Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the world. The Swiss and British balloonists aiming to be the first to circle the world nonstop floated over the Pacific Ocean Thursday after making it across China. The Swiss-British team hoping to be the first to fly a balloon around the world nonstop passed south of Japan today, trying to avoid thunderstorms that ended the flight of a rival team this week. The adventurers, Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England, steered their balloon over the Pacific Ocean toward Hawaii and California or Mexico. A Swiss-English balloon team soared over Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to travel nonstop around the world. Pilots Brian Jones of England and Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland have flown further than any balloonist before, traveling more than 21,625 miles after leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1. After nearly a 20-day voyage, Swiss Bertrand Piccard and British Brian Jones completed their nonstop circumnavigation on a hot-air balloon and landed in southern Egypt smoothly Sunday morning. The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that they will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon. Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon
