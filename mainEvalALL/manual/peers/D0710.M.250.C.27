
BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ More than 20 people, including a woman, have been arrested on suspicion of spying for Israel, a Beirut newspaper reported Sunday.
They also visited Cyprus and stayed in Ziyi between Oct. 15 and Oct. 22, when the army was conducting its annual exercise nearby.
Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy operation.
Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
There were no other details.
We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home.''
A ministry statement added that the two were not acting against Cyprus, but gave no further explanation.
Unshaven and in the same clothes they wore on the day of their arrest two weeks ago, the two were brought to Larnaca from Nicosia in two separate cars.
Both men bowed their heads as they were escorted into the courthouse to avoid the waiting photographers.
Peres said he had ``very, very friendly talks'' with President Glafcos Clerides, ``and I think all the problems were clarified.''
The proprietor of a local taverna, Panikos Cristoldo, had been alerted to notify the authorities if they returned.
Diplomatic activities are widely said to be underway between the two sides, because they want the affair to end quietly.
The two Israelis will appear again before the court
