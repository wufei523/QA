The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
Congress passed that bill in May, two developments have occurred on the missile-defense front: --Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed, for the first time, to consider reopening the landmark 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to consider easing that prohibition against either American or Russian nationwide ballistic missile defense systems. --After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
President Clinton vetoed an earlier bill committing the nation to a missile-defense system.
Approved in the early 1990s, the program to create a mobile ground missile defense system against medium-range ballistic missiles would be used overseas, if it is ultimately deployed.
Perhaps in the years to come, a workable national missile defense system will be developed.
It was designed to test elements of the national missile defense system -- such as an "in-flight interceptor communication system" used to send information from the ground radar to the interceptor missile -- that will be used in the next attempt to
