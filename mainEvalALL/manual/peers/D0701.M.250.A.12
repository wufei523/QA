COEUR d'ALENE, Idaho _ Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here. Richard Girnt Butler, the 82-year-old self-described pastor of the Aryan Nations compound, and his deputy, Michael Teague, were ordered to pay most of the $6.3 million in damages by the nine-woman, three-man jury. ``We intend to take every single asset from the Aryan Nations now and forever,'' Dees said at a news conference after the verdict was announced. The guards were liable for most of the remaining amount. The plaintiffs, Victoria Keenan, now 44, and her son, Jason, now 21, who were beaten and shot at by three security guards for the Aryan Nations in July 1998, had asked the jury for nearly $12 million in compensatory and punitive damages.
