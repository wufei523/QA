Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.  In their [Jones and Piccard] first attempt at circumnavigating the world, the two have beat the record set last year by American millionaire Steve Fossett, British tycoon Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand of Sweden.

The big balloon [Breitling Orbiter 3], which completed its epochal flight on March 21, has been offered a berth at the museum, taking its place with a host of other famous aircraft.  Besides earning a place of distinction in the [National Air and Space Museum] -- part of the Smithsonian Institution -- Piccard and Jones have already received another reward for their record-breaking journey: Anheuser-Busch Cos., the beer brewer, paid them $1 million for becoming the first to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air balloon.  

The International Olympic Committee said Wednesday that they will award the Olympic Order to balloonists Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones who are the first to circumnavigate the world in a balloon.
