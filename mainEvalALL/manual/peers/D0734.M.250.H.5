
NEW YORK, November 5 - A U.S. National Institutes of Health sponsored panel has concluded that acupuncture merits inclusion in the comprehensive treatment for certain common conditions, and called for further research in its application. Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the American healthcare system. And while many treatment centers have been using acupuncture for some time, usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been inconclusive. They were receiving methadone treatment for the heroin addiction but were still using cocaine regularly. In the acupuncture treatment, the needles were inserted five times a week for about 45 minutes per session, according to guidelines developed at Lincoln Hospital in New York, and adopted by the National Acupuncture Detoxification Association. The ancient technique of acupuncture is now being used for cosmetic surgery. Much cheaper than a surgical facelift, patients pay about $45 for each acupuncture treatment. Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation only after late U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
