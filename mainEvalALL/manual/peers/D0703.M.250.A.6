Stressing that the introduction of a single currency will be a great contribution to the unity of an expanded European Union (EU), Juppe reiterated France's commitment to the timetable and criteria of the single currency system set in the Maastricht treaty, under which the single European currency, recently named Euro, will be realized by January 1, 1999.
At present, qualms about a single currency still exist in France and many other EU member countries as some economists fear that a single currency means a country's loss of financial sovereignty.
Many people worry that the tough budgetary criteria for the single currency will cause rising unemployment and worsening social welfare.
The Administration Board of Romania's central bank (BNR)has had made a number of decisions in connection with the introduction of the single currency in the European Union's member states beginning January 1, 1999, BNR director Adrian Vasilescu said on Monday.
Vasilescu said the central bank had decided that the rates of exchange posted by hard currency operators should also include the single currency unit.
The single currency will be also used in the reports issued by the General Directorate of Monetary and Hard Currency Policy, he added.
