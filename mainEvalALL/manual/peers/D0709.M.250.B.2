Blue,'' in a red matte jersey gown with see-through insets, and Angelina Jolie of the movies ``Gia'' and ``George Wallace,'' in a nude-tone double-slip dress. Studio executives have high hopes for such star-studded upcoming theatrical releases as ``Autumn in New York,'' starring Richard Gere and Winona Ryder; ``Dancing in the Dark,'' with Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie; and ``Heartbreakers,'' featuring Sigourney Weaver and Jennifer Love Hewitt. It does boast two of this year's Oscar nominees in starring roles--Denzel Washington, who is up in the best actor category for his role of wrongly convicted boxer Rubin Carter in ``Hurricane,'' and Angelina Jolie, who received the best supporting actress nod for her role as the mentally disturbed teen, Lisa, in ``Girl, Interrupted.'' The poll's other favorites seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress. Jolie, who turned 25 on Sunday, already has three Golden Globes, for the title role in the HBO movie ''Gia,'' about a supermodel who died of AIDS; for the TV movie ''George Wallace''; and for last year's theatrical film ''Girl, Interrupted.''
