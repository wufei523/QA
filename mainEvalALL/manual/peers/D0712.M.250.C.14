
Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries. British Airways said Friday that it would not permit the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against Rushdie. The British government said Wednesday that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York on Thursday. Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said. British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended. The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333 to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday. Bocker prize winner Rushdie had been living a furtive life since 1989 under police protection in Britain following a death sentence issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for blaspheming Islam in his book the Satanic Verses.
