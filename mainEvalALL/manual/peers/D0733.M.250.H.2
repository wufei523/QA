After spending a week playing with The Library of Congress: Eyes of the Nation, a new CD-ROM exploring the American experience through documents selected from the world's largest archive, I've been partly converted, much like the wayward Puritan of the 1650s who made a ``halfway covenant'' with his faith. Anyone who wants to pinpoint where James Bond met that blonde with the bottle of champagne on her curvy hip need only consult ``Language of the Land,'' an unusual book published by the Library of Congress offering maps of imaginary places. The world's biggest library could turn into just a ''museum of books'' unless it gets started this year on long-range plans to collect and secure the rising flood of digital information, a federal advisory panel warned on Wednesday. This Library of Congress research resource accompanies its African American collections, but it stands alone as a meticulously documented exploration into the African American experience from colonization, slavery and abolition to the explosion of black arts in the 20th century. A comprehensive site offering a link to its own African American History Museum, a kids page, news, classifieds, Web links to Africa, an art gallery and a community discussion board.
