
The Israelis, arrested at a fishing village on the southern coast of Cyprus, pleaded guilty last week to approaching a prohibited military area.
The men were identified as Udi Hargov, 27 and Igal Damary, 49.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in their rented apartment.
Israel has not denied that the two are Mossad agents.
The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman ended a three-day visit to the island.
Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to ease tensions over the case.
The coming visit, the first ever to Israel by a Cyprus head of state, is a return visit to Israeli President Ezer Weizman's trip to Cyprus in November 1998.
During his stay, Clerides will hold talks with Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Foreign Minister David Levy.
Both Israel and Turkey, which occupies the northern third of the island, are interested in gaining information on the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
