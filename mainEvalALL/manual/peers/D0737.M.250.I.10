Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of suspending history in time. A report is due in four months. The lecture was the ninth of a program conceived by Mrs. Clinton as part of the White House millennium year commemoration. Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University, which already has one of the nation's leading departments for dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater archeology. Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years. A deeper Alvin would also be able to visit more of humanity's lost worlds. They say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums. Its existence is not confirmed. The first stage is to find further financial and technical partners, followed by a seismic study of the area between and according to Avner's Managing Director Eli Rosenberg. Shell will also carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Cote d'Ivoire, the report said. The robotic accomplishment represents an advanced level in this high-tech sector, experts said. Exploration of the ocean floor at 6,000-meter depth has sparked fierce competition among nations. The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more than 1,300 sites around the world. Area.
