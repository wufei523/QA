
Last year Clinton vetoed the defense legislation that contained a national missile defense program, expressing concern that it could violate a 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty with Russia. The United States has no defense against a long-range missile. The Defense Department planned to develop weapons for a national missile defense system by 1999 and then to decide whether to deploy it within three years. The Pentagon's fifth missile defense system failed to intercept a target, in May 1998, the Defense Department said in a statement. The U.S. military successfully tested an anti-missile defense system, in June 1999, by destroying a missile with another one high over New Mexico State, the Defense Department said. In a second straight success, an experimental theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile, in August 1999, at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next year. The U.S. Defense Department announced that it will skip a planned third test of an anti-missile missile. In 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union agreed in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty not to construct a national defense against such missiles. Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said, in July 2000. Britain should push the United States to halt plans for its national missile defense system, a parliament committee on foreign affairs recommended, in August 2000.
