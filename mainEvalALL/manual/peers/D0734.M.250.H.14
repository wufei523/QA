Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the American healthcare system. A U.S. National Institutes of Health sponsored panel has concluded that acupuncture merits inclusion in the comprehensive treatment for certain common conditions, and called for further research in its application. Chinese medical workers have created and are ready to popularize an acupuncture therapy for apoplexy, for which a cure is still lacking in Western medicine. Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey found. The number of Americans who are using alternative treatments such as herbal supplements, massage therapy and megavitamins is increasing dramatically, said the Washington Post Wednesday by quoting studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A study published in Monday's Archives of Internal Medicine reports that patients who received therapeutic acupuncture treatments, along with counseling, were more likely to have cocaine-negative tests than those who didn't. Acupuncture is an effective treatment for those addicted to cocaine, Yale researchers found. Scientifically-based treatments will open the world market wider to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), a national conference in Beijing was told today.
