The National Institutes of Health report that obesity is the second-leading cause (after smoking) of preventable death in the United States today, and estimate that obesity-related disease costs the nation about $100 billion a year in direct health-care expenses or in lost productivity.  The fat and fatter trend has initiated more research into obesity than ever, especially in light of another group of findings linking extra weight to myriad serious health problems, including heart disease, respiratory disease, diabetes and even some forms of cancer. 

The number of obese Americans has more than tripled since 1991 to 90 million, and recent estimates suggest that obesity-related diseases may cost Americans more than $100 billion annually.  In 1991, four out of 45 participating states had obesity rates of 15 percent or higher, while the figure for 1998 was 37 states, according to the study.  Twenty-five percent of people under the age of 18 are considered obese.  Instances of severe obesity _ not being able to fit in an airline seat _ have ballooned 350 percent over the past 30 years. 

The reasons for the obesity epidemic can be found in our culture of abundance and inactivity, said the experts on causes and treatment.  While emphasizing that human obesity stems from a combination of genes and environment _ like America's abundance of tasty, fatty foods _ the biotech scientists believe that genes involved in weight regulation are the most promising targets of anti-obesity measures.
