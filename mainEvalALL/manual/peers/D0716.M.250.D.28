
Construction begun one week ago at Jabiluka, a uranium mining lease lying within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park, listed by the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization on its World Heritage list of important cultural and environmental sites.
The World Heritage Committee report found the Jabiluka uranium mine threatened the surrounding Kakadu World Heritage area and raised the prospect of Kakadu being placed on the committee's endangered list.
The park is one of a handful of 552 World Heritage sites listed for both its environmental and cultural values.
A high-level United Nations delegation began touring Australia's Kakadu National Park to examine claims a uranium mine being built in the region. 
It is also home to Aborigines who have lived there continuously for at least 40,000 years and is dotted with their cave paintings, rock carvings and other archaeological sites.
The miner, Energy Resources of Australia Limited, told the panel that its project does not threaten the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, which are recognized by the United Nations' World Heritage Bureau.
After intensive lobbying from the Australian government, the bureau decided not to immediately put the park on its list of world heritage areas considered to be in danger.
The company has already begun construction of its Jabiluka uranium mine, which is within the boundaries, but technically not part of Kakadu.
Australia has about 30 percent of the world's recoverable uranium reserves, but has only about 14 percent of the world market.
