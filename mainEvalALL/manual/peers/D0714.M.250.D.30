
  In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
  Heavy metal rock band Metallica has accused three universities and the makers of a popular Internet music sharing software of copyright infringement and racketeering.
  Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
  The recording industry complained that the ability to download free songs threatens to undermine the very core of the sales and distribution mechanism that sustains the creative juices of the musical world.
  The RIAA and the rock band Metallica have both sued Napster, alleging the company's software allows computer users to trade copyrighted music online without permission.
  Napster Inc. appointed a new chief executive and received key financial backing Monday even as a political think tank recommended tighter copyright laws to combat illegal swapping of online music.
  That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of Internet access services and search services from liability when their users transmit pirated works.
  Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
