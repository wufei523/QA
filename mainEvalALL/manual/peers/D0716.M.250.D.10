The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia. The park is almost 12,000 square miles (19,000 sq. Thousands of tourists visit the park every year. The Australian government has mounted a systematic attack on the traditions of the Aboriginal people living in Kakadu National Park, a u.n. team investigating whether uranium mining threatens the park was told. The team from the u.n. World Heritage Bureau is visiting the park to examine claims that the environmental and cultural values of the park are being threatened by the Jabiluka mine. Era and Australia's government claim Jabiluka will not hurt the park. The park is one of a handful listed for both environmental and cultural values. About 200,000 tourists visit the park every year. Australia's conservative government defied a u.n. body's declaration that Kakadu National Park is a World Heritage area by declaring it will allow uranium mining at Jabiluka within the park. The local Mirrar Aboriginal people have been among the most vocal critics of the project, which although actually inside the Northern Territory national park, has been technically excluded as an enclave within it. The government-approved mine site is in an area surrounded by Aboriginal-owned Kakadu National Park. Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
