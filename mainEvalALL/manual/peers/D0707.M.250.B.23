The European Union and Turkey have met here to discuss the latter's prospect of accession to the 15-nation western bloc, the European Commission said Wednesday.

The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey during the pre-accession period.  

The U.S. government said today that the European Union (EU) should accept Turkey as its new member in the future.  The 15-nation EU rejected a membership of Turkey last week.

Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU.  Turkish defense officials said Ankara has been an active contributor, within the framework of NATO, to European security since the Cold War.

Turkey is angry over the European Union (EU)'s decision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations.  

The European Parliament also called on the European Commission not to allow Turkey access to EU aid under the "Meda" program for Mediterranean countries. The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU.
