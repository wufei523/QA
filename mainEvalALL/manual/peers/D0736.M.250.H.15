Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime television especially rival Jerry Springer's show and is ready to bail out of her long-running show. After winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime achievement award, Winfrey is taking herself out of the running for best talk show host at this year's ceremony. The new venture would face competition from the successful Lifetime channel, which is run by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp., as well as a new channel called Oxygen, being developed by talk show host Oprah Winfrey and Geraldine Laybourne, one of the driving forces behind the success of Nickelodeon. Talk show host Winfrey is starting a magazine next spring with the magazine publisher Hearst Corp. The talk show host Winfrey, a powerful figure in the book world because of Oprah's Book Club, received a 50th Anniversary Medal from the foundation. A lawsuit accusing Winfrey using copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book will go to trial next month. Vice President Al Gore would get a sister with a touch of the mother in Oprah Winfrey; she would give him an aura of spontaneity, generosity and basically sexless titillation. Under Oprah's influence Tipper would show a touch of girlish soulfulness, while Oprah could add chipper gentility to her repertory. McGraw, and its spiritual advice giver, Gary Zukav, both appear on the talk show and are introduced as Oprah's personal counselors. Bush courts women voters by appearing on the Winfrey show as Al Gore did last week.
