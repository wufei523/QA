El Nino and La Nina, the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world, have in recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change. China has recorded new advances in the exploration of seabed polymetallic nodules in the eastern Pacific and planning for commercial mining in the next century, according to the China Ocean Mineral Resources Research and Development Association (COMRRDA). A cylindrical steel caisson, 13.8 meters tall and 38 meters in diameter, was put in April last year on the seabed in the oilfield's eastern section, where it has been used as a platform for drilling and storage of oil, according to Jiang Hengyu, manager in charge of the project. Deeper water submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank, in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily. China has a coastline of more than 18,000 kilometers and more than 14,000 kilometers of island coasts, but marine development, offshore petroleum exploration, and rapid industrial development along the coasts have caused serious environmental pollution
