More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet drug combination.  American Home Products Corp. has reportedly paid more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination fen-phen.  A company hid evidence that half of the popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp. for $110 million said Wednesday.  A Texas woman who blamed the diet drug combination fen-phen for her heart damage has agreed to settle a lawsuit against the manufacturer for a fraction of the $23.3 million a jury awarded her. 

American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination.  Drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement. A federal judge has approved the proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims stemming from the diet drug combination fen-phen, which has been linked to potentially fatal heart valve damage.  Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.
