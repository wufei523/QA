In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the United States _ criticized by Amnesty International for having the death penalty _ as countries that Britain treats delicately. "It is clear that Taliban guards are busy implementing a reign of terror in Kabul," Amnesty International was quoted as saying. The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human rights situation in Turkey in 1995. The press release accused the Amnesty International of portraying a negative image of Tanzania as a hostile country to refugees while internationally omitting the great care it has always undertaken to uphold conventions governing the accommodation of refugees. The Rwandan government has expressed deep outrage about Amnesty International's continued campaign aimed at tarnishing the image of the country. President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more serious in its work.
