	   The line is to supply electricity to Brazil, Indian communities in Venezuela and gold mining companies that plan to come to Venezuela to extract some of the largest gold deposits in Latin America.	   Tensions are rising in Venezuela's Amazon rain forests, where Indians and environmentalists are clashing with mining companies and government officials who want to exploit some of the richest gold deposits in Latin America and build towns and tourist hotels in the wilderness.	   They also want officials to overturn last year's mining and logging decree, grant them title to what they say are millions of acres of their ancestral lands and recognize their right to decide the future of the region.They searched for gold that over the centuries has attracted explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh, who sought the legendary golden city of ``El Dorado.'' 	   In Imataca they built a frontier town called Las Claritas on top of what is believed to be the richest gold deposit in Latin America.But then the government sold rights to the prized mining site to Canada's Placer Dome and other mining companies. 	But Jose Luis Gonzalez, a leader of the Pemon tribe, said Chavez   has approved mining projects, including one at Las Cristinas, the  site of what is believed to be one of the largest gold deposits in  Latin America. 
 Some South African mining companies are already operating in Venezuela and Peru, both having significant mining potential and interested in joint ventures in this field with South Africa, department sources said.
