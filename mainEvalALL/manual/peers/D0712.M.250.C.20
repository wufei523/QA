 On 14 February 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a sentence of death on British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence. LIEGE, Belgium ( AP ) Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him. TEHRAN, March 13 ( Xinhua ) Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at presidential office said here today. Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death in 1989, claiming The Satanic Verses blasphemed Islam. TEHRAN, Iran ( AP ) An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty. LONDON ( AP ) Iranian hard-liners said Sunday that the 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said. TEHRAN, Iran ( AP ) British writer Salman Rushdie sees new safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether anything has really changed.
