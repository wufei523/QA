Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global positioning satellite. The China-made robot completed its deep-water video record, measurements of the ocean bottom, investigation of water conditions and search for missing objects while automatically recording data, according to the report. A multinational scientific team has recovered the first rock sample from deep beneath the Antarctic ocean bed in a bid to reveal what happened in the frozen continent 30-100 million years ago, an Australian earth scientist on the team said today. ''We must continue to try to conquer the seemingly impossible, to discover the unimaginable, to find out more about what's out there, and in the process about ourselves and what's here'' Clinton announced federal participation in three new undersea exploration projects: A deep-water canyon off the coasts of New York and New Jersey; reefs deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's Gulf Coast; and an ocean mountain range off California. Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an astonishing trove of data. The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied in new places, McCann said.
