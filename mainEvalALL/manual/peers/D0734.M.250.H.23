A U.S. medical expert committee today endorsed Chinese traditional needle therapy acupuncture as part of the mainstream American medicine.  "The NIH-sponsored panel pointed out that when incorporated into a comprehensive medical teatment program, acupuncture may be as effective as many accepted conventional medical therapies," AAMA said.

Acknowledging that a growing number of physicians are recognizing the effectiveness of acupuncture, the panel called for significant funding for research in all disciplines of acupuncture to see how medical acupuncture can best be integrated into the American healthcare system.  "For the first time there is a public statement from the Health and Human Services that acupuncture might have a role in treating certain health problems," said Dr. Helga Well-Apelt, a medical doctor who uses Chinese medicine in her practice.

Although Chinese practitioners have long offered acupuncture in the U.S., the therapy moved toward the mainstream in the nation only after late U.S. President Richard Nixon's visit to China in 1972.  Almost two-thirds of traditional U.S. medical schools now teach alternative therapies, including chiropractic, acupuncture, herbal remedies and mind-body medicine, a survey found.

Many centers are conducting comprehensive studies on the effects of individual therapies _ the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for one, is researching complementary treatments for asthma, while George Washington University's Center for Integrative Medicine in Washington, D.C., is looking at the use of acupuncture in treating carpal tunnel syndrome.
