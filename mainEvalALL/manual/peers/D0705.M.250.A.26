Adams was greeted at the start of his half-day stay by some 100 Basque independence supporters waving Irish and Basque flags. Credited with encouraging the armed Basque separatist group ETA to call the truce has already been sent to South African President Nelson Mandela and the United Nations. ETA began an indefinite and condition-free cease-fire in its campaign for an independent Basque state that it hopes would unite territory in northern Spain and southwestern France. Since then, the government has been under pressure from both hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred to the Basque country, or at least closer to it. The conservative party opposes Basque separatism and other moves to change Spain's political makeup. No one took responsibility for the shooting, but Interior Ministry officials blamed ETA, which began its campaign for independence of the three-province northern region. Basque police said a man identifying himself as a member of the Basque armed group ETA warned of an imminent explosion at the disco. ETA, whose name stands for Basque Homeland Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for Basque independence.
