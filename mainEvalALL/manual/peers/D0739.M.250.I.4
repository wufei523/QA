
Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld. Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy. For one thing, the team that assembled his new show consists of three former ``Seinfeld'' writers, including Spike Feresten, author of the legendary ``Soup Nazi'' episode. ``It was just fun'' Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO special. Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct. 24 on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7). A judge threw out a $100 million lawsuit filed by a man who claims Jerry Seinfeld and his TV producers stole his identity for the character of George Costanza. ``I never thought I'd end up in the movie version of `Rocky and Bullwinkle,''' Jason Alexander says, flashing a cherubic grin tinged with mischief. Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in Learning).
