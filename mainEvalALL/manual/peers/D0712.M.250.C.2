The decree by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remains in force, ``and nothing will change that,'' the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps said, according to the radio report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. on the eve of the anniversary of the ``fatwa,'' or religious edict. The pledge shows the continuing division over Rushdie, who was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic republic, ruled that his book ``The Satanic Verses'' was blasphemous. The 1989 death sentence ordered against British novelist Salman Rushdie remained in effect, despite the Iranian government's statements more than a year ago that appeared to lift it, an Iranian radio report said. Cook met Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in New York, and Kharrazi said his government was distancing itself from rewards offered for Rushdie's death. ``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam Khomeini... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying. Iran warned on Sunday it's ties with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues
