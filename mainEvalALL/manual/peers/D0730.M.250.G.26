
 The Line Item Veto Act was struck down. Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case. Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws. In passing the law, Congress said the president could cancel individual items in tax and spending bills. Congress was allowed to try to reinstate the items by having both houses pass them in separate bills. The president could veto an entire spending measure but not individual items. The issue is likely to be decided by the Supreme Court. The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed under the Republican Party's Contract with America policy document. In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it. The 6-3 decision, written by Justice John Paul Stevens cast aside government arguments that in canceling specific lines of the budget the president was merely exercising authority delegated to him by Congress. The court found that the line-item veto violates the ``` presentment clause of Article I. That clause establishes the process by which a bill becomes law. President Bill Clinton said he was disappointed by the ruling, but expressed confidence the line-item law will be upheld by the Supreme Court.
