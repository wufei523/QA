Mrs. Tripp's federal immunity from prosecution from independent counsel Kenneth Starr may not save her from the Maryland prosecutor, who is gathering evidence independent of the tapes and her sworn testimony to Starr.  A Maryland grand jury investigating Linda Tripp subpoenaed one of her lawyers Friday, demanding that he produce any tape recordings Tripp made of former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.  Linda Tripp, whose secret recording of phone conversations started a White House sex scandal investigation, entered the federal courthouse Tuesday for her third day of testimony.  Maryland prosecutors have asked the federal judge overseeing a grand jury investigation of President Clinton for access to Linda Tripp's secret tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported.  The attempt by a Maryland prosecutor to try Linda Tripp on state wiretapping charges for secretly tape-recording her telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky has revived passions that have been dormant since President Clinton's impeachment trial.

In refuting the suggestion that Mrs. Tripp betrayed the trust of a vulnerable woman half her age, a person close to Mrs. Tripp's legal team suggested that Mrs. Tripp had tried several times last fall to end her [Linda Tripp] friendship with Ms. Lewinsky, who would sometimes call and e-mail Mrs. Tripp ``20 times a day.''  It was Tripp, Lewinsky told the grand jury, who was at least partly responsible that the semen-stained Gap dress was never cleaned, thus preserving genetic evidence of the sexual relationship between Clinton and Lewinsky.
