After winning 32 Daytime Emmys and a lifetime achievement award, Oprah Winfrey is taking herself out of the running for best talk show host at this year's ceremony.  Oprah Winfrey is fed up with the sleaze on daytime television -- especially rival Jerry Springer's show -- and is ready to bail out of her long-running show.

Schultz said she could not comment beyond a statement issued Monday, which said no announcements were planned on whether Winfrey would continue the show after the end of her current contract.  ``My [Oprah Winfrey] contract has two years left, then I am getting out of such shows because I feel they are going to burn themselves out.

George W. Bush courts women voters by appearing on the Oprah Winfrey show as Al Gore did last week.  ''A recent poll showed that Gore has opened up an 18-point lead among women, while Bush held about a 20-point lead among men.  Gore's appearance on the "Oprah" TV show kicked off a week in which Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman hope to solidify gains among women voters by focusing on education policy and pledging to clean up entertainment violence marketed to children.
