
European Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said Thursday that Europe's new single currency, the euro, won't compete with the U.S. dollar as the currency of choice for foreign reserves. BNR and Romanian commercial banks that want to perform euro services will have to open accounts in euro by January 4, 1999, the first scheduled day of euro use, and inform their foreign partners. "Romania's Central Bank (BNR) and the country's commercial banks fear little about the introduction of the euro and will easily adapt to it," BNR Foreign Currency Director George Mucibabici told a recent colloquium on euro in Bucharest. The introduction of the single European currency, the Euro, would pose strategical as well as tactical problems to the economy of Romania, an associate EU country seeking admission, the Rompres news agency Thursday quoted Romania's Central Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu as saying. Private investors are set to benefit from the 1999 introduction of the single European currency, the euro, thanks to expanded investment opportunities, reduced currency risks, and rising competitions, the German central bank Bundesbank said Monday. Only 20 percent of German companies have taken concrete steps to get prepared for the Euro, Rexrodt said, adding that the country's state institutions were also not well prepared. In response to a question concerning the issue at today's news conference, Zhu said the introduction of the Euro is expected to stimulate European integration, help establish a more balanced world financial system and exert influence on the world's economy and politics.
