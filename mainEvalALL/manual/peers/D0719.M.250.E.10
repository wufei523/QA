While the national figure is 11.8 percent, the rate can top 50 percent in some neighborhoods. The figure reflects a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems. The improved figures were largely due to a gain in jobs by men aged 25 to 49, according to the Labor Ministry. Unemployment is one of France's worst economic problems, with joblessness among young people a major problem that has contributed to a rise in crime and violence. The New York Times said today that the long-term trends emerge from detailed figures that the u.s. Labor Department has just published. The figures showed that the u.s. joblessness peaked at 9.7 percent in 1982, the first full year of President Reagan's administration. Figures for Japan, Germany, France and Italy have continued to edge up in 1996. A new French law went into effect that encourages businesses to cut working hours and hire more workers. Moreover, 36.89 percent of these people have been seeking jobs for more than one year. Unemployed people staged a series of protests from Christmas through New Year festival by occupying the offices of government agencies in charge of unemployment insurance. The government said that the number of jobs offered increased by 20 percent from 1996 to 1997, while the number of lay-offs decreased by 17 percent. The unemployment rate in France now stands at 11.2 percent, with 2,770,400 people in the labor force in search for a job.
