
Gingrich filed for divorce July 29 from Marianne Gingrich. Cobb County Judge Dorothy Robinson made the Gingriches' divorce final and agreed to seal the agreement. A lawyer for Newt Gingrich says the former U.S. House speaker and his wife have signed a final divorce settlement and are ready to take the agreement to a Cobb County courtroom. Gingrich will marry Callista Bisek on Aug. 18 in Alexandria, Va., said Randy Evans, the former House speaker's personal lawyer. 

Evans said this week that Gingrich is prepared to split the couple's marital assets and pay his wife alimony. Marianne Gingrich says it's been hard to speak of the end of her 18-year marriage and her husband's affair. Newt Gingrich's attorneys have and Marianne were separated when the relationship with Bisek began. Bisek has asked a Washington judge to block Marianne Gingrich's subpoena asking her to answer questions about her relationship with the former speaker. In a surprise move, Newt Gingrich has initiated his own deposition of the Washington congressional aide named in his divorce. A judge ruled Thursday that a congressional aide linked romantically with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich must testify in his divorce case. The agreement gives Mrs. Gingrich the couple's house in Marietta, Ga., and Gingrich their Washington apartment. 

Mrs. Gingrich's attorney, John Mayoue, has denied the allegations. Randy Evans, Gingrich's attorney, filed a motion Wednesday in Cobb County Superior Court asking that Marianne Gingrich be forced to transfer the money to a joint account within 14 days.
