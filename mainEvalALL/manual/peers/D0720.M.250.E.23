The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.  The Oslo Accords, signed by his [Netanyahu] predecessor, late Yitzhak Rabin, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat prepared the ground for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process on the principle of "land-for-peace." 

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace" principle by "peace with security" since he took office in 1996.  Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted that he [Netanyahu] ignores the Oslo accords.  According to the Oslo accords, a permanent peace agreement should be signed between the Palestinians and Israel by [May 4].

The APU pointed out that it is an international responsibility to save the Mideast peace process by compelling Israel to abandon its policy of settlement and to declare its commitment to the principles of the peace process, particularly the land-for-peace principle.  

A senior Palestinian National Authority (PNA) official Thursday urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.  PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
