 	Mark Barton, the 44-year-old day trader at the center of   Thursday's bloody rampage, was described by neighbors in the  Atlanta suburb of Morrow as a quiet, churchgoing man who worked all  day on his computer. Barton and the children were found in Mrs.   Barton's apartment after Barton went on the rampage at two  brokerage offices, killing nine people. 	At Piedmont Center, Barton opened fire again, killing five more   at All-Tech Investment Group -- another day-trading firm where  Barton had been a client.  -- Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were   among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day  trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said.     Many of them came together to share their experiences at a memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church Sunday, a year and a day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through All-Tech Investment Group's trading office.    The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.    Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.    On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history.
