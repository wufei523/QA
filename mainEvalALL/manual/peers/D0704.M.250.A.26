
 The statement said that Turkey is surprised and disappointed to find itself again the target for unfair accusations by Amnesty International, adding that the Amnesty International's annual report gives a distorted and defective picture of the human rights situation in Turkey in 1995. In a report, the organization cited China, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and the United States criticized by Amnesty International for having the death penalty as countries that Britain treats delicately. In an audit of Cook's pledge, Amnesty International praised Britain for, seeking to set up an International Criminal Court in Rome, publishing an annual report on human rights, banning land mines, and taking limited measures to restrict arms sales to countries that may use them to commit human rights abuses. Amnesty International uses the term prisoner of conscience, for people punished for their ideals rather than for criminal acts. Amnesty Internation's report was to call for stepped-up pressure up against police violence and maintains that human rights violations continue against Indians and the landless, Fiona Macaulay, the organization's Brazilian researcher. Amnesty International released a press statement in which it accused the army of killing several hundreds of civilians for the January-February period. The release deplored the organization's report for relying only on complaints made by the opposition party without carrying any considerations or views of the government and the ruling party.
