
Officials with American Home Products, the drug company, declined to comment. The combination became known as fen-phen. American Home made the fen in fen-phen. In October, Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products announced it would pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits. Attorneys representing thousands of fen-phen users said they won't participate in the settlement. 

American Home reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen. More than 2,600 individual lawsuits have been filed against fen-phen, and class-action lawsuits. An estimated 6 million people in the United States took fen-phen. 

American Home made a diet drug called fenfluramine, the "fen" in fen-phen. American Home withdrew Pondimin. Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home Products marketed fenfluramine -- half of the fen-phen combination and Redux, a similar product. Lawyers for Ms. Moore said American Home Products knew fen-phen caused serious heart problems and underreported the number of cases of primary pulmonary hypertension. Madison, N.J.-based American Home made fenfluramine, the "fen" in the fen-phen combination, and gave the drug a brand name of Pondimin. In September 1997, the drugs were removed from the market after a Mayo Clinic study linked fen-phen to potentially fatal heart valve damage. Last month, another woman took American Home Products to court over heart-valve damage. The plaintiffs also name the manufacturers of the phen part of the combination. Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products is the nation's seventh-largest pharmaceutical company. Interneuron said American Home first learned of health dangers of fen-phen as early as February 1997.
