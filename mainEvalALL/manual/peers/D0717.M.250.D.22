Attorneys determined they couldn't seat an impartial jury to hear Debbie Stone Lovett's case against American Home Products Inc and subsidiary. American Home argued that Ms Moore has a mild and common disorder. Last month, American Home reached a settlement in the first trial over heart-valve damage from fen-phen. Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home Products Corp. The company, American Home Products Corp, is close to settling most of the thousands of diet pill lawsuits filed against it for at least $3 billion. In October, Madison, N.J. - based American Home Products announced it would pay $4.8 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits. American Home Products Corp agreed late Tuesday to pay $350 million to settle 1400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over its diet drug combination fen-phen. The two fen drugs sold by American Home Products were Pondimin and Redux, or dexfenfluramine. A Mayo Clinic study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart valve damage. American Home Products pulled Pondimin and Redux off the market in 1997 at the Food and Drug Administration's request. Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home Products marketed fenfluramine, half of the fen-phen combination, and Redux. American Home Products has agreed to pay $ 3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits the company announced today.
