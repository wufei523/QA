
Aaron J McKinney killed a gay student at the University of Wyoming last year in ``a five-minute emotional rage'' because the student, Matthew Shepard, had made sexual advances that reminded him of homosexual abuse he had suffered as a child, McKinney's lawyer told a jury on Monday as his murder trial began here. On Oct 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22, lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo. Henderson, 22, is serving two life sentences after pleading guilty to murder and kidnapping. A jury has now convicted Aaron McKinney of murder, kidnapping and robbery in the case, and he could face the death penalty. The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection. According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping. But Shepard's killing has touched off an intense reaction among gays and lesbians nationwide because of its extreme brutality and timing. Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays and lesbians.
