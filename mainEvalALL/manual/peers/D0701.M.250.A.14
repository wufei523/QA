
In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist group. An FBI agent identified the reporter as Trish O'Kane, who writes for Intelligence Report, a magazine of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group in Montgomery, Ala. The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday. Several years ago, when Morris Dees of the Southern Poverty Law Center initiated a letter-writing campaign to dissuade bookstore chains and distributors from stocking William Pierce's novel "The Turner Diaries," much of America thought the KlanWatch founder was overreacting to the violence of a handful of white supremacists. The Southern Poverty Law Center represented the predominantly black Macedonia Baptist Church in Clarendon County, which won a $21.5 million judgment against the Christian Knights and Klan members after the church was burned four years ago. Issuing a verdict that civil rights organizations hope will bankrupt one of the nation's largest white-supremacist groups and limit its ability to preach hate, a state jury in northern Idaho Thursday ordered leaders of the Aryan Nations to pay more than $6 million to the victims of an attack two years ago by men who were serving as security guards at the group's compound near here.
