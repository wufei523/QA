The Interior Department proposal would classify most of the wolves -- all those except the Mexican gray wolf in the Southwest -- as threatened rather than endangered. The small population of Mexican gray wolves recently introduced to parts of New Mexico and Arizona -- only 22 wolves -- would remain endangered because they continue to be under the threat of extinction, officials said. Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf -- also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered species success story.'' While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as ''threatened'' may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said. The federal government is preparing to announce that the gray wolf _ which was once nearly shot, trapped and poisoned out of existence in the lower 48 states _ is abundant enough in a few places that it no longer uniformly needs the strict protection afforded the country's most endangered species.
