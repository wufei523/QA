There, the 12-year-old discovered that though the shooting and shelling of the volatile occupation years was over, Lebanon had not seen the end of the heartache. On the very day Israel pulled out -- May 24 -- he stepped on an antipersonnel mine that chopped off his left leg above the knee and badly damaged his right leg. 

International anti-mine campaigners said Thursday that a global treaty against the use of mines has made a difference in the first year and a half of its life, but problems remain. Countries that have ratified the treaty were to meet in Switzerland next week. Neither Israel nor Lebanon has signed the treaty. 

According to police, nine people have died and 62 others injured in explosions of land mines and unexploded shells since the Israeli withdrawal from the border zone it held in Lebanon for 18 years as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla attack. 

U.N. officers estimate at least 50,000 mines were planted, most by Israel and its Lebanese militia allies in their fight against elusive guerrillas. Guerrillas also planted mines. 

Lebanese authorities had planned an awareness campaign to warn people of the danger of mines and unexploded shells.
