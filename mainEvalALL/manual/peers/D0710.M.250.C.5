
Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday. The statement also said the two men were not acting against Cyprus. The two Israelis, who enter Cyprus on false passports, were arrested Nov. 6 in the coastal fishing village of Ziyi. NICOSIA, November 19 - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday. The two Israelis, Udi Hargov and Igal Damary, were arrested here on November 7 after police raided their apartment and found hi-tech equipment tuned into the police radio frequency. The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests. "Y" also had offered his resignation earlier this year after Swiss police arrested five Mossad agents for allegedly spying in a residential area of Bern, Israel radio said. The Mossad has been known to use Cyprus for training missions, and Gad Shomron, a former Mossad agent, conjectured that the two Israelis, who had previously visited Cyprus, were on such a mission.
