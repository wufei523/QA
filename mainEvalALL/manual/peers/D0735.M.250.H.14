
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said endangered Mexican gray wolves are here to stay, and the former Arizona governor meant it, as more wolves arrive today (WED. JAN 13) in the Apache National Forest. A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing "incomprehensible," and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program - and the goal of returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade - will continue. The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. Four endangered Mexican gray wolves have been freed to roam the Apache National Forest, the first of their breed released this year in efforts to restore the animals in their natural habitat. WOLF KILLED-ARIZONA (Undated) - Someone killed yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought back to the wild this year. Ms. Fascione said that for her, the possibility of interbreeding between wolves and coyotes was the biggest concern about the success of wolf restoration in the Northeast. The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a 1997 decision by a Wyoming federal judge who ruled that a government wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park and central Idaho was illegal.
