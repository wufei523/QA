A US federal judge ordered Wednesday Microsoft Corp to be split in two separate companies to correct antitrust violations. A federal judge described as the company's monopolistic practices. Microsoft paid membership fees of $125000 a year. It remained in litigation and would be appealed by Microsoft. A major industrial nation had investigated many of the same practices as those in dispute in the Microsoft trial in Washington and had not found an anticompetitive effect. Microsoft's take: The government proved no wrongdoing in the eight-month trial. Microsoft charges PC makers for its Windows operating system. Microsoft is competing vigorously and legally. Microsoft did precisely that by bundling its Internet Explorer browser with its Windows operating system. The company claims would undermine computer performance. Microsoft did not intend to make substantive changes. The Justice Department and at least 19 states plan to file historic antitrust cases Thursday against Microsoft. Microsoft did violate tying law. Microsoft illegally used its dominance in the operating systems market to hurt competition. That rough-and-tumble competition hurts a company's rivals. Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions. DR-DOS competed with Microsoft's MS-DOS. Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case. Jackson should view the case differently than he might have viewed a case against a smokestack company. The voluminous record including volumes of e-mail, internal Microsoft documents and witness testimony show Microsoft to have been an arm-twisting monopolist, whose corporate behavior stifled competition and harmed consumers.
