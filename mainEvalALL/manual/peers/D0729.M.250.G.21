 -- Authorities did not discount a possible   connection between a bombing at an abortion clinic here and serial  bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, though they weren't discussing  Rudolph on Sunday. 
 	Last week, a task force source said the mission will not be   dismantled until Rudolph's capture or proof he has left the area. 
 -- The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a manhunt for more than two years.    Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was hiding in the familiar woods near his home. ``We've said all along that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting alone,'' Enderson said. ``We still believe that.''    What was unclear to investigators was why the man waited at least two days to report the pickup stolen, giving Rudolph time to escape with another six months' worth of food, which he also allegedly stole from the man.There's a million dollar reward for information leading to Rudolph's capture.    ANDREWS, N.C. _ Federal agents searching for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph have found what they believe was an observation point where the fugitive watched the Nantahala residence of a man whose help he tried to enlist for food and other provisions.
