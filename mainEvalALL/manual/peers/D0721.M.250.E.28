There is no guarantee that these laws will stop hate crimes from happening.
The legislation would add offenses motivated by sexual orientation, sex or disability to the list of hate crimes already covered under a 1968 federal law.
There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate Crimes Unit.
Federal lawmakers last week dropped provisions of a bill that would have expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by victim's sexual orientation.
In the aftermath of the Wyoming killing, the same groups that worked overtime to stigmatize gay people have mounted a furious propaganda defense to assert that their words and ads demeaning gay people have nothing to do with any anti-gay crimes.
In the evening, Robert Denhardt, a visiting county judge, ordered Aaron McKinney, 22, to stand trial on charges of first-degree murder, robbery and kidnapping.
The other defendant, Russell Henderson, pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping earlier, and is serving two life sentences.
The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
