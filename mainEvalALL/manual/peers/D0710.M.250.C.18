Asked Sunday if they were Israeli agents, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, " Every Israeli citizen is important to us.
Cypriot police had said they suspected the Israelis were spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
On their next trip in early November, Cyprus monitored the two Israelis as soon as they arrived at Larnaca airport on forged passports, the paper said.
Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday.
The two deny they are spies, but their arrest soured relations between Cyprus and Israel and came only days after President Ezer Weizman ended the first ever official visit to the island by an Israeli head of state.
The Israeli government has not acknowledged publicly that the two are Mossad agents, saying only that they did not spy on behalf of Turkey and were not trying to hurt Cypriot interests.
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has received personal thanks from Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Ehud Barak for freeing two Israelis jailed in Cyprus.
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit to the island country in 1998.
