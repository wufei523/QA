The wolves, which once roamed from Canada to Mexico, have been stalked for centuries like no other animal, starting in 1630, when the Massachusetts Bay Colony paid a month's salary for each one killed. By the time they received federal protection in 1973 there were only a few hundred left. 

But nowadays, with more than 3,500 wolves living in eight states, US Fish and Wildlife Service officials said it is time to ease the tough nationwide protections they have enjoyed under the federal Endangered Species Act. 

``Wolves are a living symbol of the regard Americans have for things wild,'' said Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, announcing the proposal to reclassify wolves from endangered to threatened in the Northeast and two other regions and to strip them of all federal protection in 30 states. Endangered species get more legal protection than threatened species. 

Babbitt's optimism may seem odd in New England, where there are so few wolves that a single sighting is big news, and environmentalists are pushing a controversial plan to import wolves to replenish the stock in Maine or New Hampshire.
