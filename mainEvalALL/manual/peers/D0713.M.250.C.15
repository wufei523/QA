China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Some countries or international organizations expressed concerns after Pakistan exploded five nuclear devices on Thursday in response to the nuclear tests carried out by India on May 11 and 13. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien called on Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign on the NPT and the CTBT. The nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan were of concern for regional and global stability and security. The tests not only violated the NPT but also threatened peace and stability in South Asia. Russia on Thursday repeated its call to Pakistan to join the NPT . Pakistan's prime minister said Wednesday his country would unilaterally adhere to the nuclear test ban treaty, but called on international pressure to force rival India to do the same. Both India and Pakistan carried out nuclear tests last May, drawing international sanctions and calls to sign the test ban treaty. In a statement he made on behalf of Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, the spokesman regretted the position taken by the Sixth Review Conference on the NPT toward the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan in May 1998. Under the 1970 NPT, the five countries were the only ones allowed to maintain nuclear arsenals.
