
Turkey, on October 25, 1996, accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to Turkey. The U.S. government said, on March 12, 1997, that the European Union should accept Turkey as its new member in the future. Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU. The British ambassador to Turkey, in January 1998, indirectly expressed the hope that Turkey could participate in the European Union meeting scheduled for March in London, according to the Anatolia News Agency. Delivering a speech at the Balkan Foreign Ministerial Meeting opening, in June 1998, in Turkey's largest city of Istanbul, Pangalos said that Turkey is an European nation and its efforts for full EU membership should be encouraged. The EU ambassador to Turkey, Karen Fogg, insisted that the report "did not signal a new status of Turkey but the confirmation that Turkey is a candidate country,." Turkey said, in December 1998, it wants the European Union to make it a formal candidate for membership at its summit later this week. Turkey is angry over the European Uniondecision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations.
