Police in Henry County, Ga., which includes the Atlanta suburb of Stockbridge, released the letter Friday as the authorities searched for clues to the motive behind Thursday's killing spree, the deadliest in the state's history. On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history. As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history. Last Christmas, Mark O. Barton sat down with his estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market. Colleagues who had lent Mark Barton money were among those killed in his shooting spree last week at two day trading offices, the lead investigator in the case said. A third lawsuit resulting from Mark O. Barton's July 29 killing spree at two day trading firms has been filed in Fulton County State Court. The first civil lawsuit filed in the Buckhead rampage that left nine people dead and 13 people wounded claims a securities firm frequented by mass murderer Mark O. Barton could have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized their traders more carefully.
