
 Who can forget Linda Tripp standing in front of the TV cameras and assuring the American people : I 'm you. A Maryland grand jury is considering whether Tripp broke Maryland law by recording conversations with Lewinsky. Lewinsky : A little bit, but for me, the point of that meeting was I had gotten to a point where Linda Tripp wasn't returning my phone calls, and I felt I needed to devise some way to cushion the shock of what would happen if Linda Tripp testified all the facts about my relationship, since I had never disclosed that to the president. Tripp, 48, a Pentagon employee, had grown tired of Lewinsky's constant talk of her alleged relationship with President Clinton. Why was I so fascinated by the excerpts of conversations between confidante Linda Tripp and blabbermouth Monica Lewinsky as they scrolled across the newswire? In a series of conversations Lewinsky told Tripp about her White House affair with President Clinton and, allegedly, about attempts to cover it up. Can anyone think of a principled justification for releasing the videotape of the president but not the audio tape of Linda Tripp? asked Rep. Barney Frank. Tripp was indicted for illegally taping phone conversations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Another possible area of inquiry: Starr's failure to inform the department that he and others on his staff had contact with lawyers working on Paula Jones sexual harassment suit against President Clinton.
