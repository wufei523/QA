While wolves may be given somewhat lower levels of protection, the increased flexibility provided by reclassifying them as "threatened" may make it easier for wolf populations to expand into areas in which they currently are not found, federal wolf experts said.
Despite a quartet of unsolved wolf killings, two disappearances and three recaptures, the second year of a controversial wolf reintroduction experiment will see more wolves than ever this winter _ perhaps as many as 17.
Their findings, not yet published, suggest that the timber wolf of eastern Canada and formerly of the eastern United States, long considered a subspecies of gray wolf, is in fact a separate species and may be more closely related to the red wolf than the gray.
If these wolves are shot to death, it could only be by someone who purposely wanted wolves dead.
The wolves would be removed from all Endangered Species protection in all or part of 30 states where wolf introduction is unlikely.
Nor will the plan change the status of Mexican gray wolves, a subspecies being reintroduced to the Southwest, or of red wolves in the Southeast.
This is unheard of, but so is putting a couple of dozen wolves out in the middle of a few hundred thousand
