
After the plan to reclassify some wolves under the Endangered Species Act is  published in the Federal Register for public comment, perhaps next month, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will begin putting together a recovery plan for wolves in the Northeast, said Paul Nickerson, a wildlife biologist who heads the agency's regional office of endangered species in Hadley, Mass. Between conflicting theories of intentional sabotage and random accidents, Collins shares another theory that the wolves were intentionally shot by different people in opportunistic moments of frustration. Jamie Rappaport Clark, director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, said the recovery of the gray wolf -- also known as the timber wolf in some parts of the country -- was ''an endangered species success story''. But the recovery of the wolves has been impressive across the northern tier of the country from Michigan to Minnesota and in the northern Rocky Mountains where the animals were reintroduced in Yellowstone National Park in 1995. Much smaller populations in Montana, Wyoming and Idaho could be reclassified from endangered to the less-dire category of threatened, giving wildlife officials greater flexibility in controlling those wolves and managing their habitat as their numbers increase. Of the 11 wolves released in this inaugural year of the recovery program, five have been killed, one is missing and presumed dead, and five have been returned to captivity for breeding in acclimation pens near Alpine, Ariz. These killings have sabotaged the program, they have set the program back substantially.
