
The heavy metal band Metallica, in April 2000, dropped legal action against Yale University after the school agreed to block access from their computer network to an Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music. Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music sharing software. Computer users who download the Napster software can then use the Napster site to list the music stored on their computers. Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went, in May 2000, to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site. In a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge, in July 2000, ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels. Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a preliminary injunction and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight. Several small institutions, including Amherst and Smith colleges, are blocking Napster on their computer networks this fall because so many people on campus were clogging up the Internet systems as they downloaded music from Napster's huge catalog of recordings.
