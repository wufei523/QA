
Dr. Andrew Weil, arguing for their acceptance, and Dr. Arnold Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment that the mainstream medical community is ignoring alternative medicine. A new study by Yale University researchers says acupuncture is an effective treatment for cocaine abuse. The finding gives the ancient Chinese remedy a much-needed foothold in Western medicine, because it's based on a well-controlled clinical study from a major American medical school. While many treatment centers have been using acupuncture usually in combination with other therapies, scientific studies of its effectiveness in treating cocaine addiction have been inconclusive. At Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, one of the most prestigious hospitals in Los Angeles, cardiac patients are given the option of receiving acupuncture or massage therapy. With these patients and dollars in mind, about 13 percent of U.S. hospitals provide alternative therapies, according to a survey of about 1,000 hospitals by the consulting firm Deloitte & Touche. In common is that they all fall outside the list of standard therapies approved by U.S. government agencies and medical authorities. An estimated 83 million American adults, more than four out of 10, used some form of alternative medical treatment said a new survey by a Harvard research team. Many of these facilities are fully staffed with medical doctors.
