
Besides, Netanyahu said he did not intend to travel to the birth place of the Oslo Accords since he had no part in the historic peace agreements. Following months of secret talks held in Oslo, the Israeli and Palestinian negotiators reached agreement on August 20 of 1993 on principles of Palestinian self-rule, widely-known later as the Oslo Accords which started the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Israel is still at loggerheads with the Palestinians over its withdrawal from the West Bank, although the two sides should have moved forward to final-status talks two years ago according to the Oslo Accords. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had repeatedly attacked the Oslo Accords for being incomplete and failing to address Israeli security concerns, has replaced the "land for peace"principle by"peace with security" since he took office in 1996. That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago, they said. Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community. Addressing a press conference here, PNA Minister of Planning and International Cooperation Nabil Sha'ath said that Israel should implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed with the PNA instead of making its own decisions which are against the provisions of these agreements.
