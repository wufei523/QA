The requirements include four years of English; three years of math; two years of social science; two years of lab science, two years of foreign language; one year of visual or performing arts and one year of electives. By some estimates, only 25 percent of American schools offer music programs as a basic part of the curriculum. This is Inner City Arts, a nonprofit arts school that is both an enlightened model for arts education and a design landmark where education is embellished by architectural example. The design is also an object lesson in construction. Results of the study were released. The Bingham Academy, in its third year, offers a five-week program for five disciplines: creative writing, dance, instrumental and vocal music, theater and visual arts. Centralizing information about the arts is another matter. In a variety of ways. Flamenco, for example, ties into social studies and language arts lessons on the history and culture of Spain. Test scores are rising. People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation, not violence. Standardized tests have improved many American schools. And classical music in Cuba could, from this point of view, use a little rescuing. Arts exchanges are only part of the business. The last argument may be in trouble. Given the national obsession with high-stakes tests, they reasoned, it made sense to promote art and music classes as a way to boost test scores.
