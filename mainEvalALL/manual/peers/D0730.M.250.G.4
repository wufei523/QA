
Judge Thomas Hogan ruled that the law -- which gives the president the power to strike items from tax and spending measures without vetoing the entire bill -- violates the traditional balance of powers between the various branches of government "The Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional because it impermissibly disrupts the balance of powers among the three branches of government," said Thomas Hogan. ``The line-item veto act was a vital force in restoring the appropriate balance of power, and eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel spending,'' said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. "We ought to give the Supreme Court a chance to have their say on it" "I think the line-item veto is very important in helping to preserve the integrity of federal spending and I hope very much we can sustain it and we have to appeal it," Clinton told reporters as he was leaving a meeting with newspaper editors from around the nation. The line-item veto was apppealed to the Supreme Court shortly after it was approved by Congress, but the justices threw out the case, saying that the plaintiffs _ Byrd and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, and then-Senator Mark O Hatfield, the Oregon Republican _ didn't have standing for their complaint. Government and hospital officials in New York state praised the Supreme Court's decision to strike down the president's line-item veto power Thursday, saying that it would preserve a set of state hospital taxes that help finance health care for the poor.
