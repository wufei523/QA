WASHINGTON - Vice President Al Gore will take his first formal step toward running for president in 2000 by notifying the Federal Election Commission that he has formed a campaign organization, aides to the vice president said Thursday.
Vice President Al Gore, in a show of political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire and Iowa.
Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R. I., on Friday endorsed Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2000.
Outside the hotel, nine activists affiliated with the group called ACT-UP carried signs calling Al Gore a "drug company puppet" and mocking his campaign as " Apartheid 2000."
Sen. Edward Kennedy will endorse Al Gore for president Wednesday in a move the Gore campaign hopes will help with voters in New Hampshire, next door to Kennedy's Massachusetts, and with wavering Democrats nationwide.
He sought the presidency himself in 1980 and has served in the Senate not only with both Gore and rival Democratic contender Bill Bradley but with the vice president's father, Al Gore Sr., in the 1960s.
He has entrenched power, he has a president who is supporting him, loyal to him (as he was loyal to the president) he's got most of the DNC (Democratic National Committee), he's got most of the big Democratic fund-raisers, he rides on Air Force Two.
