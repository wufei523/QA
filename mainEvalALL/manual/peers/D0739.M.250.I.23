The show left no indication of where Seinfeld hopes to take his comedy, now that he's told these jokes for the last time.  Seinfeld has vowed that he won't do another TV series, but before he bolts off again, he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.  In the last few weeks, Seinfeld has been polishing his show on a tour that has taken him to the likes of Iceland, Australia, England, Kansas City and Des Moines.

Madison Avenue has long been enamored of the actors who took the principal roles on ``Seinfeld'': Jason Alexander, who played George; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Elaine; Michael Richards, Kramer; and Jerry Seinfeld, who in a demonstration of his extraordinary range and ability portrayed Jerry Seinfeld.  Richards, who will play private detective Vic Nardozza in ``The Michael Richards Show'' on NBC, is still casting the series after he and his co-producers, all former ``Seinfeld'' writers, decided it should be an ensemble effort instead of a star-driven comedy.

But the movies that filled that slot were taken out of development and it [NBC] would take months to get any stockpile of movies established.  In fact, he [Phil Morris] hasn't even met formally with Seinfeld or David or NBC about a comedy series based on the wacky attorney.

He [Larry David] famously returned for the series-ending show, which managed to combine excessive hype and mini mal laughs for one of TV's biggest flops.
