
Iran announced here, on March 11, 1996, that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries. Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a high-ranking official at presidential office said here, on March 13, 1996. Iran warned, in March 1998, it's ties with Norway might further worsen if Oslo continues support for Salman Rushdie, a British writer condemned to death by Iran for his "blasphemous" novel. The British government said, in September 1998, that it would continue to press Iran to lift the death sentence against the author Salman Rushdie when its foreign secretary, Robin Cook, meets the Iranian foreign minister in New York. British author Salman Rushdie, speaking after Iran distanced itself from an Islamic death sentence against him, said that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended. British Airways said that it would not permit the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against Rushdie. British writer Salman Rushdie sees new safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether anything has really changed. Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him.
