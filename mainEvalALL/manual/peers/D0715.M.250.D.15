A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to sign the treaty. South Africa is to join more than 100 countries in Canada this week to sign a treaty banning the use or possession of anti-personnel mines. The South African Campaign Against Landmines has called on President Bill Clinton of the United States to sign a treaty banning landmines. More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect. Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months. Nations that ratify the treaty pledged to destroy all stockpiles of mines within four years and clear away all mines from their territory within 10 years. Despite a treaty signed by 135 countries to ban their use, production and stockpiling, anti-personnel land mines appear to be as popular as ever in fighting wars these days. The treaty the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction went into effect March 1, 1999, six months after the 40th nation ratified it, but it has little force. The International Campaign to Ban Landmines has called on all 14 member states of Southern African Development Community to join the mine ban treaty.
