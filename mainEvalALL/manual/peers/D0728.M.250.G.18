A standard AIDS drug appears to slow liver damage caused by hepatitis B. A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at the effects of the drug 3TC on people with long-standing infections with the virus.
She also has been taking a pill that may be a drug called ribavirin, which can boost the effectiveness of interferon and double its cure rate.
One of the studies, led by Dr. John G. McHutchison of the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, California, compared the effects of the combination with interferon alone in the initial treatment of 912 patients.
All signs of the virus disappeared in 38 percent of patients who had been given both drugs for 11 months, compared with 13 percent of those treated with only interferon.
However, more patients who received the new therapy suffered from side effects, which included difficulty breathing, sore throat, rashes, itching, nausea, insomnia and anorexia.
The best interferon produced by the genes was 285,000 times as potent as interferon alpha-2b, which is marketed as a drug, as measured by its ability to protect cultured cells against a mouse virus.
And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.
Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
