
The music industry has some fresh ammunition in its effort to prove that Internet swapping of free music files has cut into music sales. Representatives of the heavy-metal band Metallica went Wednesday to the headquarters of Napster Inc. with 13 boxes of papers said to list more than 300,000 computer users who, without the band's permission, had recently downloaded Metallica music from other users listed on Napster's Internet site. The heavy metal band Metallica on Wednesday dropped legal action against Yale University after the school agreed to block access from their computer network to an Internet site that allows people to trade copyrighted music. Yale blocked access to the Napster site last week after Metallica filed a lawsuit against the school, two other universities and California-based Napster, which makes the popular Internet music sharing software. The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated. Napster's software allows music fans to easily share their MP3 music files through the Internet. Hatch said the Senate will keep "a close eye" on the raging copyright fight between the recording industry and Internet music distributors, such as San Mateo-based Napster, but will take no action now. Celebrity and politics collided Tuesday on Capitol Hill, as a rock musician joined online music executives and members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the effects on the recording industry of downloading music from the Internet.
