A three-day conference on the land mines ban is being held in Ottawa, Canada, and most of the participating countries are expected to sign the treaty.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect.
Burkino Faso became the 40th country to ratify an international treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines Wednesday, meaning the treaty will go into effect in six months, the United Nations announced.
The Ottawa Treaty was signed in December 1997 by 135 countries, 74 of which have ratified it.
Chissano called on joint efforts by all countries and the international community to implement the Treaty, which was effective in September, 1998.
Though the international organization admitted that Angola does not produce or export land mines, it said they have found, in Angola, about 60 kinds of anti-personnel land mines imported from over 10 countries.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
Without U.S. support, Leahy added, "a lot of countries will say, " Why should we sign when the United States, the most powerful country on earth, says it's not strong enough to give up land mines?"'
