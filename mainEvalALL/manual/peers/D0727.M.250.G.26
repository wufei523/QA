Newt Gingrich, 56, who has admitted to having a six-year affair with a House congressional aide, filed for divorce. With the agreement, Newt and Marianne Gingrich end a tense legal standoff and avoid a potentially embarrassing public divorce trial. Very intense negotiation, Randy Evans. The settlement closes five months of bitter legal wrangling in the case, culminating with Gingrich's admission that he's had a romantic relationship with a Washington congressional aide for six years. The Bisek deposition is among several disputes that have marked the contentious case since the twice-married Newt Gingrich filed for divorce. Each party is in a conference room, and the mediator goes back and forth between each group. Gives them both support to live off of. District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Brook Hedge ordered the attorneys for Bisek and Marianne Gingrich to meet to discuss a subpoena ordering Bisek to be deposed and to produce a wide range of evidence. Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has handled the couple's money. The length of the relationship, which predated Gingrich's ascension to the speakership of the U.S. House, surprised his wife.
