Some viewers, surveying the mostly feeble comedies that remain since Jerry and the gang left prime time in 1998, may have glumly concluded that no, there is not. But is there life after ``Seinfeld'' for the show's cast? Michael Richards is about to find out. 

For nine seasons, Richards played Kramer, a human pinball who was perpetually careening through Jerry Seinfeld's apartment door when he wasn't concocting loony get-rich-quick schemes with Newman the mailman. Kramer became a cult figure on one of the most successful sitcoms of all time. 

Now, the 52-year-old Richards is bringing his mobile features and his gift for slapstick to a new NBC sitcom titled ``The Michael Richards Show,'' which premieres Oct. 24 on WHDH-TV (Ch. 7). He will play Vic Nardozza, a disguise-wearing private investigator who specializes in undercover work, and whom Richards describes as ``an American Inspector Clouseau.'' 

Clouseau, not Kramer: Like most actors, Richards seems leery of being typecast. He says NBC was ``wide open to a new invention'' that's not a mirror image of his most famous creation. ``They didn't say `Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, we like the concept. Now, are you going to have your hair up? How are you going to come through the door?' '' 

Not that Richards is entirely leaving ``Seinfeld'' _ or Seinfeld _ behind.
