
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Congress violated the principle of separation of powers when it gave the president the power to cut individual projects from tax and spending bills without vetoing the entire legislation. The U.S. Supreme Court Thursday struck down as unconstitutional the line-item veto law that lets the U.S. President strike out specific items in tax and spending measures. The Supreme Court on Thursday dealt a blow to the power of U.S. presidents, striking down as unconstitutional a law that enabled chief executives to delete individual funding items from massive budget legislation. The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen. John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the president expanded veto power to harness "pork-barrel" spending by Congress. U.S. President Bill Clinton said today he has not yet decided whether to strike out individual items in the comprehensive tax and budget bills awaiting his signature, noting that his new line-item veto authority ought to be used "somewhat sparingly." Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth 287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military construction spending bill. In a 6-3 decision, the high court ruled the Line Item Veto Act violated the constitution's separation of powers between Congress, which approves legislation, and the president, who either signs it into law or vetoes it.
