And he sounded reassured by the discovery that Rudolph apparently spent the last five months in the hills of western North Carolina.
Federal officials had long said they assumed that Rudolph, an avid outdoorsman who has been described as a survivalist, was hiding in the familiar woods near his home.
``We've said all along that we had strong reason to believe that Eric Rudolph was in this area, had not left this area, that he was alive, that he was acting alone,'' Enderson said.
There has been just one confirmed sighting of Rudolph since his disappearance, in July 1998.
McCraw said Rudolph may have been involved in a February 1999 break-in at a restaurant, but the perpetrator did not leave any fingerprints or other forensic evidence.
A $1 million reward has been offered for information leading to his arrest, but some people in the area have said they believe Rudolph may have gotten help from sympathetic locals.
Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan. 16, 1997, bombing of a north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the Feb. 21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay clientele.
The attacks killed two people, including an off-duty police officer in Birmingham, and injured 124.
Rudolph remains on the FBI's list of the 10 most-wanted fugitives.
