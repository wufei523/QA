The United States and Israel, which suspect that Iran may want to acquire nuclear weapons, have opposed the Russian-Iranian nuclear cooperation. 
He said the various inspections of Iranian nuclear installation conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indicated that Iranian nuclear capability is for humanitarian and peaceful purposes. 
But the tests do not put Iran under pressure to start its own nuclear weapons program, Shamkhani said. The present arena concerns only India and Pakistan, he was quoted as saying. 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the accusations indicated the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iran, adding that the United States has spared no opportunity to stop Iran's economic development plan. 
Commander of Iranian Naval Forces Abbas Mohtaj said on Sunday that the forthcoming joint Iran-India naval game has nothing to do with Iran's stand towards nuclear tests carried out by India and Pakistan last month. 
The Iranian commander said Iran has already voiced concern and transparent view about the nuclear tests of both India and Pakistan, adding that Tehran supports the comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) and believes that any action by any country to carry out nuclear test is provocative. 
Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever growing stock of nuclear arsenal. 
Khosravi refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the IAEA has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
