Nicosia -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has admitted that the two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of espionage against Cyprus are Mossad agents, Cyprus News Agency reported. During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers. Netanyahu has not confirmed or denied reports that the two men in custody in Nicosia, Cyprus are Mossad agents. Haaretz has reported that the two men are agents of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, and that they were part of an intelligence operation near Ziyi. The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which is responsible for overseeing intelligence agencies, declined comment. Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect issues which seriously concern Cyprus. Israel has admitted the two were agents from its Mossad intelligence agency. Two agents of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency were released by Cyprus.
