US Vice President Al Gore Thursday named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take over his presidential campaign. President Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his boss. Wednesday, Gore's campaign had been run from high-rent offices on K Street in Washington. Gore needed to loosen up on the campaign trail. Vice President Al Gore on Saturday took his presidential campaign to a living room that helped launch Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton into the White House. Vice President Al Gore named a veteran of the Clinton-Gore presidential campaigns to be his campaign press secretary. Stacie Spector, deputy communications director at the White House, will move over to the Gore campaign to assist campaign manager Craig Smith and be director of strategic operations. Villarreal will be legally responsible for the Gore campaign's filings with the Federal Election Commission. He is moving his campaign to State of Tennessee. Gore's announcement came with a growing concern within the Gore campaign about the threat from Democratic Bradley and Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush. Among registered Democrats, Gore led Bradley, 56 percent to 32 percent, up from the 15-point lead the vice president held two weeks ago. The senator and Vice President Al Gore visited Wednesday night.
