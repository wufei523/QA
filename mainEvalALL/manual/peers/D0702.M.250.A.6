One way of getting families to value the arts as much as they value math is to measure student progress with traditional assessment tools, and New York State has started doing so by introducing standards that outline what students should learn through arts instruction.
But Terry L. Baker, an education consultant who is trying to measure the effectiveness of the Annenberg programs, said educators still are not sure how to assess a student's grasp of such ``abstract, emotional and spiritual'' subjects as music and painting.
``If the arts are going to be taken seriously, they have to be held accountable in the same way that other disciplines are,'' he said.
``Music really enhances the learning experience, even if it doesn't necessarily spawn geniuses or people who excel in particular areas,'' Rose said.
Still, some arts educators insist that music and art classes can affect overall student achievement.
Arnold Aprill of the Chicago Arts Partnerships in Education said expanding the arts in Chicago schools has improved students' attitudes toward other subjects, spurred parents to get more involved, and even raised test scores.
That ``confirmed the nation's commitment to having students educated in the arts and made grant money available to develop art programs and to train teachers,'' said Melinda Malico, a spokeswoman with the department.
In 1998, a sampling of 6,600 eighth-grade students from across the country was tested for knowledge of the arts.
