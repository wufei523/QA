
In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial. Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to "unbundle" the two drugs, marketed as a product called Rebetron, so that patients could use Ribavirin with another brand of interferon. Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease. But researchers say that not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms, anemia, depression and suicidal behavior. In another hepatitis treatment development, Glaxo Wellcome and Biochem Pharma said Wednesday that the FDA had approved their drug, lamivudine, as the first oral therapy for the treatment of hepatitis B. In the United States, the drug will have a wholesale cost of $1,250 a year. The drug, also known as lamivudine or Epivir, is one of several that block production of an essential viral protein known as reverse transcriptase. Fisher's is selling Ribavirin for $225 a month and, separately, an interferon not made by Schering-Plough for $420 a month.
