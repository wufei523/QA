On his part, Kyprianou said that during his discussions with the Israeli ambassador, he raised the issue of the military cooperation between Israel and Turkey because "it creates an atmosphere of concern to both Cyprus and Greece and to other countries in the region."
He said Tzur told him that the alliance is of a technical and commercial nature and has nothing to do with Cyprus, nor should it affect the very good relations between the two countries or the relations between Israel and Greece.
Kyprianou said Cyprus does not oppose alliances between countries in the region, but stressed that these should not affect issues which seriously concern Cyprus.
Cyprus arrested two alleged Israeli Mossad agents less than 48 hours after Weizman's departure from Nicosia during his first visit to the island country in 1998.
They were caught spying on a secret military shipment near Larnaca, Cyprus' southern coast and were sentenced to three years in prison for trespassing on a prohibited military area in February last year.
The two were released six months later.
Suspects Udi Hargov, 37, and Igal Damary, 49, have been remanded for eight days and were transferred Sunday to Nicosia for further investigation at an unspecified location, reports from Cyprus said, adding that the two are being held separately.
Cyprus has expressed concern over the military alliance between Turkey and Israel, but is also keen on maintaining good relations with Israel.
