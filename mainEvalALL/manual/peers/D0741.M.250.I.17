
The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader. At the end of the day, the trader cashes out, returning the next day to roll the dice again. That day trader could have made as much as $400. Before he killed his wife with a hammer... Before he murdered his sleeping children... Before he went on a shooting spree that killed nine people and injured 12... Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, in July 1999, and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle. In the ensuing shooting spree, however, five customers were killed. A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before killing himself as the police tried to arrest him. Barton sat down with his estranged wife and confessed to huge financial losses as a day trader in the stock market. "This wasn't a shooting spree," Walden said. The first civil lawsuit filed in the Buckhead rampage that left nine people dead and 13 people wounded claims a securities firm frequented by mass murderer Mark O. Barton could have prevented the multiple killings if employees had scrutinized their traders more carefully. Many of them came together to share their experiences at a memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church, in July 2000, a year and a day after former trader Mark Barton began firing randomly through All-Tech Investment Group's trading office.
