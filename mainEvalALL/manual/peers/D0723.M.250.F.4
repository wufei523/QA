
Dianne Feinstein and Paul Coverdell, conceding Tuesday that the Senate won't cancel the Clinton administration's decision to certify Mexico as a drug-fighting ally, proposed a ban on business dealings with foreign companies that serve as fronts for drug cartel smuggling. Feinstein, a strong law-enforcement supporter, is the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee's panel on technology, terrorism and government information. Feinstein was first elected to the Senate in 1992 and has earned a reputation as a no-nonsense centrist who works well with Republicans as well as Democrats. Feinstein won her election that year to serve out the remaining two years of Pete Wilson's term when he resigned his Senate seat to become governor. ``I believe I can continue to be effective in the Senate'' After three statewide campaigns in the 1990s, the 64-year-old former San Francisco mayor has become one of the most recognized and popular politicians in the state. Discussing her priorities for the next Congress, Feinstein said she will push for the construction of new schools and work to discourage the practice of ``social promotion,'' in which students are moved from grade to grade without any testing of their skills. Feinstein said banning these generic AIDS drugs in Africa would have caused needless suffering and death in countries where AIDS is so widespread it is a public health emergency. Under Feinstein's proposal current owners of handguns and semiautomatic firearms that can use detachable ammunition clips would have up to 10 years to get licenses.
