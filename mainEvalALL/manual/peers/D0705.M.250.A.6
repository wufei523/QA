ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom, demands the right to self determination for Spain's three Basque provinces in the north.
It envisions an independent state that would also incorporate Basque regions in southwestern France.
Historically, the Basques have maintained a separate cultural identity and language.
Three bombs, claimed by the Basque separatist ETA, went off in the southern Spanish city of Malaga early today but nobody was injured.
The explosions, seemed to be designed to cause no casualties and little damage, were the latest of a series of small blasts reported this week in the area.
Local police evacuated an area near the city park after receiving a warning call from someone claiming to be an ETA member.
Carlos Iturgay, the Popular Party spokesman in the Basque country, said talks with the Eta should not be considered.
The opposition Spanish Socialist Workers Party said the week-long cease-fire was insufficient and that the Eta would have to offer more before negotiations could be considered.
The Basque regional government, which is led by the moderate Basque Nationalist Party, said the cease-fire provided a reason for hope but called on the Eta to give up its arms altogether.
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar said that the week-long unilateral cease-fire started today by the militant Basque separatist group Eta is a propaganda stunt.
