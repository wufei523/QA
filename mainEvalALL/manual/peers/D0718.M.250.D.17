
The Starbucks Coffee Co. plan to acquire Pasqua Coffee is leaving a bitter aftertaste in the mouths of some patrons of the San Francisco-based coffeehouse. Starbucks, the nation's largest coffee retailer, announced, in December 1998, that it would buy Pasqua for an undisclosed amount. The nation's tea industry has seen its great, shining hope -- and thinks it might be Starbucks Coffee Co. Starbucks will soon be offering a new kind of Joe. Starbucks set out to be a bridge among peoples and among cultures, not to sell more coffee. Starbucks Coffee Co. announced a new a consumer products division for its specialty ice cream, bottled coffee drinks and other products sold away from its own shops. All are countries that grow coffee for Starbucks. They opened the latest in their 50-50 joint venture Starbucks Coffee stores and Johnson said there will be more in Seattle, along with one of Johnson's multiplex movie theaters. Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the atmosphere. The problem, Starbucks said, is not that profit from coffee shops is falling. Starbucks, the Seattle-based coffee retailer, will also help hype Kozmo as it enters new markets. A recent deal between Starbucks and the urban delivery specialist Kozmo.com_ in which Starbucks will essentially set aside space in its coffee shops for Kozmo -- may be the first example of an established retailer offering its floor space and personnel to an e-commerce company.
