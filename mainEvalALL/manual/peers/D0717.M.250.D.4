
More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against American Home Products, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the fen-phen diet drug combination. A company hid evidence that half of the popular diet-drug combination fen-phen caused serious heart problems, a lawyer for a woman suing American Home Products Corp for $110 million said Wednesday. Since Pondimin, American Home Products' brand name for fenfluramine _ the ``fen'' in fen-phen _ and Redux, a similar drug, were removed from the market in September 1997, 6,500 lawsuits covering 11,000 people have been filed. American Home Products has agreed to pay $375 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today. American Home Products Corp has reportedly paid more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination fen-phen. American Home Products Corp agreed late Tuesday to pay $350 million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert. American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9 million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston Chronicle reported today. In October, Madison, NJ-based American Home Products announced it would pay $48 billion to settle fen-phen lawsuits.
