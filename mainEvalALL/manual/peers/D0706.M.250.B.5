
Myanmar's military government has detained another 187 members of pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's party, bringing the total to 702 arrested since a crackdown began in May, the party said Friday. Myanmar has been ruled by the military since 1962. The legislation, passed in 1996 by the U.S. state of Massachusetts, forbids state agencies from contracting with companies or individuals doing business with the military government of Burma, also known as Myanmar. In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country Myanmar, Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power, build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities. The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will hear the case next year ; the junta was dropped as a defendent because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign government. U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications between two Burmese military commanders.
