The diagnosis turned out to be much worse: She had hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver. She had probably been infected 15 or 20 years before, her doctor said, and, like 85 percent of all patients, she had developed a chronic infection. The vast majority of people with chronic hepatitis C carry the virus indefinitely, apparently with few ill effects. Mrs. Buchanan, who has four grown children and runs her own business, a ceramics studio, had never even heard of hepatitis C. ``I was terrified,'' she said. But those who test positive for the virus but have no signs of disease will face difficult questions about whether to start treatment, because it is expensive, complicated by severe side effects and, in more than half of patients, unable to eradicate the virus. The newly approved treatment, known as Rebetron, works far better than sole standard treatment. But it is expensive, it poses serious side effects and works in only about half the patients who take it. The treatment consists of a six-month course of interferon injections and ribavirin capsules. That therapy eliminates the disease in only 10 percent to 20 percent of patients. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) Dr. Leonard Seeff, a senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, who was not involved in the study, said those results meant there was a good chance that the effects would last. A combination of two virus-fighting drugs has proved considerably more
