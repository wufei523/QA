
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed. In waters off Virginia and North Carolina, scientists have found cracks in the seabed that might set off a tsunami. 

Herakleum is the second city which was found deep in the Mediterranean water after Menouthis was discovered in 1934. The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied in new places. Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many years. 

Ballard, a former Naval officer and oceanographer, uncovered the Phoenician vessels about 30 miles off Israel with the aid of an underwater robot, deep-water tracking equipment and a global positioning satellite. American explorer Robert Ballard has located their two ships--the world's oldest known deep-water sea wrecks--using the same techniques he used to find the Titanic. Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years. 

``It's way underfunded,'' Fornari said of the nation's efforts at deep exploration, still led by Alvin. A deeper-diving Alvin could not only explore the sites directly but could wire the ocean with sensitive detectors meant to track distant seaquakes.
