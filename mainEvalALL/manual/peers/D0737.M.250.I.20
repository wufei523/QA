 Ballard said the ocean's deepest waters are capable of suspending history in time. Shell will also carry out deep water explorations in the waters of Angola, Congo and Coted'Ivoire, the report said. Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water ( scientists call this production of deep water ): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica. Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were better preserved than any found in shallow water. And it was last year's remarkably successful Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often tradition-bound field of archeology, she said. While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed. By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and physical studies by several scientists, Broecker has concluded that the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water all the time, as had been thought. The general manager told a workshop organized by the Nigerian Association of Petroleum Exploration that the country's deep water terrain could hold the key to meeting the government's set target of increasing daily crude oil production to four million barrels per day and total reserves to 40 billion barrels by the year of 2010. In 1991, China was officially recognized
