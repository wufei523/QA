
American Home Products has agreed to pay $8 million to $9 million to a Houston woman in what could be the largest settlement to date for any individual claiming harm by the fen-phen diet drug combination, the Houston Chronicle reported today. American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today. Lawyers representing millions of people who used the diet drug combination fen-phen are negotiating a national settlement of health claims against the manufacturer, American Home Products Corp., a lawyer confirmed today. In a major step toward resolving health claims against the diet drug combination fen-phen, drug maker American Home Products said just 1 percent of the drug's users have opted out of a multibillion dollar settlement. The manufacturer of the diet drug combination fen-phen is in talks to settle millions of health claims brought by people who contend the drug caused leaky heart valves and often-fatal lung problems, lawyers said Thursday. American Home Products' Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division marketed the "fen" drugs fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were combined with phentermine to make "fen-phen." A federal judge has approved the proposed $3.75 billion national settlement of health claims stemming from the diet drug combination fen-phen, which has been linked to potentially fatal heart valve damage. Jury selection began this week in a class-action lawsuit against American Home Products, which made fenfluramine.
