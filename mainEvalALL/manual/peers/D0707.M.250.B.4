  
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations. Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara. The European Union spoke highly of Turkey's accession-oriented achievements and the emphasis of the meeting was put on the importance of the assistance the EU nations would give Turkey during the pre-accession period. Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou said Friday that his country was keen to see neighboring Turkey become a candidate for European Union (EU) membership. Turkey is angry over the European Union (EU)'s decision to exclude it from a European defense mechanism, warning the EU not to take for granted the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) facilities in Turkey for EU-led operations. It urged the EU member states to show their " necessary reactions to this preventive attitude of the European Parliament" The European Parliament, angered by Turkey's human rights record, voted Thursday to freeze hundreds of millions of US dollars in aid to Turkey for setting up a customs union with the EU. But it will help smooth Turkey's path into the European Union, and may permit a solution to the Kurdish conflict, Turkey's most vexing internal problem. Turkey tonight accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to Turkey.
