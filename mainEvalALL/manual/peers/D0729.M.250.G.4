
The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta bombings. Rudolph was publicly linked to the Atlanta attacks last month when it was learned a Tennessee gun dealer identified Rudolph as the man who bought a special order of 50 pounds of smokeless powder four years ago. US Federal authorities on Wednesday charged Eric Robert Rudolph, one of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives, with bombings including one blasted in the Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics. About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western tip. After four bombings in 19 months in Georgia and Alabama, the bombings stopped, and the chief of a regional bombing task force said Tuesday he believes the reason is that agents have kept fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph bottled up in North Carolina's mountains for a year. The FBI is paying outdoorsmen familiar with the remote mountains of western North Carolina to watch for signs of serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, who has eluded a manhunt for more than two years.
