Sydney, 13, and 10-year-old Justin Simpson, the children of Simpson and his slain ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, have been at the center of a custody battle between their father and their mother's parents.
The Browns have long fought Simpson over custody of the children, but Leckie said Simpson is now on good terms with his children's grandparents and they're closely involved in their upbringing.
Simpson's lawyer, Bernard Leckie, said Monday that an agreement giving custody to Simpson was ready to be signed.
In the civil trial, Simpson was held liable for the 1994 deaths of Ms Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman and was ordered to pay $335 million in damages.
Simpson's appearance, scheduled for Wednesday, was to promote his participation in a two-hour Internet ''chat'' session on Thursday where members of the public can pay a fee to ask him questions.
Simpson, who insists he is innocent, said he still receives tips about possible leads in the case and hopes the Internet site may attract people with helpful information.
Simpson will go on the Internet next week to field questions from the public and try once again to convince America that he didn't kill his ex-wife and her friend.
Schiller, who collaborated with Simpson on a jailhouse book, ''I Want to Tell You,'' recently directed another miniseries from his book ''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' a recounting of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case.
