WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fresh prodding from President Clinton, the Senate is having another go at expanding the list of hate crimes and giving federal prosecutors more leeway in bringing hate crime charges.
But while an almost identical bill was passed overwhelmingly by the Senate last year, this time it has touched off heated debate over whether the measure infringes on state and local powers of law enforcement.
Supporters cited the 1998 death in Jasper, Texas, of James Byrd, a 49-year-old black man, who was dragged behind a pickup truck; and the death, also in 1998, of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old homosexual University of Wyoming student, who died after being beaten into a coma and tied to a fence.
Neither state had a hate-crimes statute.
''Hate crimes are modern day lynchings,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
, the principal sponsor.
''They tear at the heart and soul of our country''.
Kennedy's legislation was headed for a vote Tuesday as an amendment to an unrelated defense bill.
Clinton met with Byrd's family Monday in Houston and renewed his appeal for Senate passage.
He also put in a few calls to wavering senators.
Byrd was dragged to death on a country road by a trio of white men.
''Crimes motivated by hate are really fundamentally different and I think should be treated differently under the law,'' Clinton said.
''I ask all of you to stand up with this fine family.
We have to pass this legislation''.
