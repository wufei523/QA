Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has filed for divorce from his wife of 18 years, saying his marriage is ``irretrievably broken''.
In a motion filed in Cobb County Superior Court, Gingrich asked a judge to give his wife Marianne 14 days to transfer the money to a joint account the couple agreed to set up last month until their divorce is final.
In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
She also asks that Newt Gingrich be ordered to stop any ``further transfers or concealment'' of assets, and replace any assets he has already transferred.
On Thursday, accusations of wrongdoing and the mining of dirt in the former U.S. House speaker's divorce case gave way to a secret settlement between Gingrich and his wife of 18 years, Marianne Gingrich.
A court-appointed mediator who spent 12 hours negotiating a settlement agreement between the Gingriches filed her report Friday, saying the couple came to a ``full settlement'' early that morning.
Chuck Clay, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said the divorce settlement will likely make it easier for Gingrich to return to the public eye in a political setting.
The settlement closes five months of bitter legal wrangling in the case, culminating with Gingrich's admission last month that he's had a romantic relationship with a Washington congressional aide for six years.
