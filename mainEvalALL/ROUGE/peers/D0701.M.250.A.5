In his suit here, Dees, a founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a woman and her son, both white, who were attacked by guards near the compound in July 1998.
Over the last two decades, the Southern Poverty Law Center has taken the Ku Klux Klan and other hate groups to court, starting with a successful suit against the Invisible Empire Klan, which in 1979 attacked a group of peaceful civil rights marchers in Decatur, Ala.
In 1987, the center won a $7 million verdict for the mother of Michael Donald, a black youth who had been lynched by members of the United Klans of America in Mobile, Ala.
WASHINGTON, March 3 - The number of organized hate groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.
Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
