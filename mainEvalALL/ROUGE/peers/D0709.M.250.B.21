-- Angelina Jolie, the disruptive mental patient in ''Girl, Interrupted,'' won the Academy Award for best supporting actress Sunday night, a generation after her father took home an Oscar.
The poll's other favorites also seemed to reflect pre-Oscar conventional wisdom: Denzel Washington for leading actor in ''The Hurricane,'' Hilary Swank for leading actress in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' Michael Caine for supporting actor in ''The Cider House Rules,'' and Jolie for supporting actress.
''I know my responsibility is to my work and what the films say,'' Jolie said.
''My personal life, however it's interpreted, it's not my responsibility to have a personal life that everybody's comfortable with''.
LR; LOS ANGELES _ When Angelina Jolie was a little girl, her brother would point a home video camera at her and plead, ``C'mon, Ange, give us a show''!
