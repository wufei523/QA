JERUSALEM (AP) _ The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot Justice Ministry said Sunday.
A Cypriot police source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand hearing Nov. 16.
Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with Israel in the past two years.
JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Cypriot restaurant owner who tipped police to the activities of two Israelis suspected of spying is actually a Cypriot security agent, the daily Haaretz reported Friday.
Haaretz, citing a Cypriot source, said the two Israelis now in police custody in Nicosia were under surveillance during a previous visit to Cyprus in mid-October, but were allowed to leave because of a lack of incriminating evidence.
Police found surveillance equipment and recording devices in their rented apartment.
Cypriot police officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Haaretz the two men were believed to be spying on behalf of Turkey, a military ally of Israel.
Israel's Foreign Ministry has said only that reports that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey were not true.
