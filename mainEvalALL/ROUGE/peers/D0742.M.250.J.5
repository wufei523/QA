NEW YORK - Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law, NBC News reported Thursday.
John and Carolyn Kennedy were on their way here to attend the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, youngest daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, who like his brother the president was assassinated in the 1960s.
Despite a self-described love of privacy not unlike that of his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, John Kennedy Jr. had been in the nation's limelight for most of his life.
After Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
, traveled to Bridgehampton, N.Y., to meet with and console John Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, the Kennedy family released a statement.
Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his passengers: his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette.
Ethel Kennedy, the widow of Robert F. Kennedy, also served consecrated wine to the dozen or so people who attended the service.
Thick haze that night undoubtedly hampered Kennedy's vision, aviation specialists said, and his limited experience in piloting the high-performance Piper Saratoga may also have contributed to the crash.
