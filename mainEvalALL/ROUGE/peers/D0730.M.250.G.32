The case the high court decided, Clinton vs.
New York City, marked the second time the justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act.
The title of the Line Item Veto Act, has succeeded in faking out the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court, in a historic ruling affecting the constitutional balance of power at the heart of the American political system, struck down legislation Thursday that permits the president to veto specific provisions of spending and tax bills.
Supporters of the line-item veto announced they would immediately offer legislation to circumvent the justices' decision by requiring each spending item approved by Congress to be listed as a separate bill for the president's signature or veto.
Stevens said the court was expressing "no opinion about the wisdom" of the line item veto procedure.
The Supreme Court struck down on Thursday what Sen. John McCain had hoped would be part of his legacy: a law giving the president expanded veto power to harness "pork-barrel" spending by Congress.
Under the Line Item Veto Act, the president could cancel tax breaks that benefited fewer than 101 people.
The line item veto, strongly supported by President Bill Clinton and a number of his predecessors, was passed in 1996 under the Republican Party's "Contract with America" policy document.
The Justice Department is planning to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal judge struck down the line-item veto Thursday as unconstitutional.
