The plane has sophisticated avionics including GPS, or global positioning system, which would enable Kennedy to be sitting on the ground in Caldwell, N.J., plug in Martha's Vineyard and get the distance and compass heading he should target.
Among other things, GPS can tell a pilot where the nearest airport is in case of emergency.
The plane also has an autopilot, that with the press of two buttons, will keep the craft at a designated altitude and heading, and by moving a dial on a compass, the pilot can turn the plane even though the auto pilot is still engaged.
Apparently Kennedy's plane wandered into such airspace near the Westchester County Airport.
An American Airlines Fokker 100 was preparing to land when air-traffic controllers alerted the plane to an unidentified airplane nearby that was ``not talking to anybody''.
The planes were close enough that the on-board traffic collision avoidance system sounded an alert on the American Airlines plane.
No course correction was required and the American plane landed safely.
The crash probably occurred because of "the pilot's failure to maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at night," the report said.
Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused by "spatial disorientation," a problem when pilots lose track of the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's surface, it added.
This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of fatal aircraft accidents, according to a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration report.
