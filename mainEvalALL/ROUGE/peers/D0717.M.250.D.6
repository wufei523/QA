The FDA withdrawal did not include phentermine, the ``phen'' of the drug combination, manufactured by several companies, primarily Interneuron Pharmaceuticals of Lexington, Mass.
No studies linked this drug with the heart valve damage.
However, phentermine manufacturers were also sued in Harris County because they allegedly marketed phentermine to prolong the usage of either ``fen'' compound from the usual 12 weeks to six months.
Phentermine manufacturers have been dismissed from most, if not all, suits around the country.
More than 4,100 lawsuits have been filed in state and federal courts against American Home Products over fenfluramine.
The company has proposed a national settlement in which it would pay $1.2 billion for future medical examinations for healthy users of the drug, and an additional $2.8 billion to settle individual suits from people who claim the drug has harmed them.
Plaintiffs' attorneys claim the company hid information from doctors, patients and regulators about possible links to heart valve disease and an often fatal lung condition called primary pulmonary hypertension.
Those people may still reject the settlement and sue for compensatory damages but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.
''There has been an overwhelming vote for approval of the terms of the settlement,'' Fishbein said.
------ The other half of fen-phen, phentermine, was never associated with that damage when taken alone and is still on the market.
More than 2,600 lawsuits over the health effects of fen-phen are pending, American Home has reported in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
