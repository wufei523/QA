Among older job seekers, men aged 50 and over saw a slight improvement in their situation, with a 0.1 percent drop in unemployment.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
- France has raised its unemployment benefits by 2.45 percent as of July 1, announced Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac, president of the unemployment insurance regime of UNEDIC.
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment situation, with "rigidity in budget policy and decline in social plans risking to push down a revival".
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.
While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
