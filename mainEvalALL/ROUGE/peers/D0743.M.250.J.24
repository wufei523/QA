A strong tremor shook already devastated towns in northwestern Turkey on Tuesday.
Scientists said Tuesday's earthquake was along the Anatolia Fault, a 100-mile arc that winds beneath northwestern provinces near Istanbul.
Over 10,000 people are estimated to be still trapped in the ruins of the destroyed buildings and houses in the stricken provinces of Istanbul, Kocaeli (Izmit), Sakarya (Adapazari), Yalova, Bursa, Bolu, Eskisehir, Zonguldak, and Tekirdag.
The number of casualties may still increase as the rescue workers are continuing sifting through piles of rubble of the collapsed buildings in the tremor-hit cities in search for survivors and the bodies of the dead.
At least 600 people have been confirmed dead and thousands of others injured in the 6.7-degree earthquake which ripped through western Turkey at 3:00 am (0000 GMT).
The death toll from the powerful earthquake in Turkey has risen to 7,085, with 33,559 injured, the government crisis center said early Friday, two days after the quake hit the northwestern part of the country.
Foreign rescue teams started leaving a week after the 7.4 killer quake struck western Turkey.
Izmit, called Kocaeli province, was the epicenter of the 7.4-magnitude killer quake that hit western Turkey on August 17.
Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey in the early hours
