Eighty-five percent of people infected with the virus in most cases will develop a chronic hepatitis and of these as many as 20 percent eventually develop cirrhosis.
The antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
The remaining 30 percent to 40 percent respond to interferon and then relapse, and those are the patients for whom Rebetron has been approved.
When treatment stopped after six months, all signs of the virus were gone in 82 percent on combination therapy, compared with half on interferon alone.
People infected with hepatitis C may have a better chance of a cure after researchers in Canada discovered a new combination of drugs to treat the disease.
Rebetron, made by the Schering-Plough Corp., was approved in June only for patients who had relapsed after taking interferon drugs, the only other approved treatment for the disease.
In June, a new treatment was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, a combination therapy that paired interferon with the antiviral drug ribavirin.
Schering-Plough's treatment, known as Rebetron, consists of Ribavirin, which simply helps another drug, interferon, fight the virus.
Ribavirin is one of two components of a combination therapy approved last year by the FDA for treatment of hepatitis C. 29 percent of the state's inmates, or about 42,000 prisoners, were infected with the potentially lethal liver virus.
Not all hepatitis C patients need Rebetron, which can have severe side effects including flulike symptoms,
