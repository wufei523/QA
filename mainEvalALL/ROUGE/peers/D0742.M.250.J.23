Federal investigators have concluded pilot error caused the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr. Kennedy, 38, his wife, 33, and her [Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's] sister, 34, were killed when the small private plane Kennedy was piloting crashed into the Atlantic off the Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts State of the United States on July 16.
Kennedy Jr.'s powerful single-engine aircraft plummeted toward the Atlantic Ocean at 4,700 feet per minute in the seconds before the fatal crash that killed him, his wife and her sister.
Forty-eight hours after John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane plunged into the ocean off Martha's Vineyard, federal officials Sunday ended their search for survivors, effectively declaring Kennedy, his wife and her sister the victims of a fatal crash.
Larrabbee said the decision to end the rescue efforts were made in consultation with the National Transportation Safety Board and had been communicated to Kennedy's family and the family of his passengers.
Between a beach he loved and the site where his life ended in a terrifying crash, John F. Kennedy Jr.'s ashes and those of his wife and sister-in-law were given up Thursday to the waters that had brought joy to his family for generations.
The service was witnessed by about 15 members of the Kennedy and Bessette families, including Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; his cousins Maria Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, and the Bessette sisters' mother, stepfather and sister.
The service was held well out of the gaze of the public.
