Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
The Food and Drug Administration Wednesday approved the expanded use of Rebetron, a treatment already on the market for hepatitis C, a viral infection of the liver that can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.
The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
Both Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., and Serono, of Norwell, Mass., manufacture beta interferon, a drug used to slow down the debilitating neurological disease.
A drug called interferon helps in 40 percent of cases, but the benefits are short-lived.
However, researchers at the State University of New York School of Medicine at Buffalo and about 50 other U.S. and Canadian sites concluded that giving patients a drug called interferon beta-1a within weeks of the first nerve inflammation cut the likelihood of developing MS symptoms within three years by 44 percent.
And they accuse Schering of bundling the products in order to maintain the high price of the drugs and compel patients to use its interferon.
In a move that could save millions of dollars, health-care contractors for the Texas prison system are purchasing a drug used to treat hepatitis C from a small Pennsylvania pharmacy rather than from a pharmaceutical company whose marketing of the drug has been controversial.
