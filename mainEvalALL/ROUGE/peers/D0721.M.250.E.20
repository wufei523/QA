The prosecution had originally asked for the death penalty for Aaron McKinney, 22, for killing Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college student, but later Shepard's parents agreed to spare him from lethal injection.
( AP ) A judge today barred defense lawyers from using a gay panic defense in the murder trial of a man accused of beating gay college student Matthew Shepard.
( AP ) Jurors saw photographs of Matthew Shepard's bloody face as prosecutors began presenting their case against Aaron McKinney, accused of beating the gay student to death in a drunken, drug-induced rage.
Escaping a possible death sentence, Russell Henderson was sentenced by District Judge Jeffrey Donnell for his part in the beating and murder of the student, Matthew Shepard, here six months ago.
In an interview, he said the Shepard murder had changed some attitudes in Laramie, including those of friends of his who no longer use the word fag to describe a gay man.
In his opening arguments, Jason Tangeman, one of Kinney's court-appointed lawyers, conceded that McKinney was responsible for Shepard's death.
Prosecutor Cal Rerucha also told the panel to remember that Shepard, who was beaten and left tied to a fence in near-freezing weather last fall, was a victim that was different, a victim that was not the same as you and I. He died on Oct. 12, 1998, and McKinney's trial begins amid several memorials commemorating the one-year anniversary of his death.
