The French Foreign Ministry issued a communique Thursday to deplore and condemn the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan on the same day.
France calls on both India and Pakistan not to conduct any more nuclear tests but to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and join talks on the banning of production of fissile materials that can be used to produce nuclear arms, said the communique.
Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement released Thursday, "We continue to urge Pakistan and India to renounce their nuclear weapons programs and to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty." He said China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, has always advocated international peace and security and nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.
"There was a complete identity of views between Pakistan and China on the gravity of the situation which had resulted from India's reckless actions and fictitious threat from China, invented by India as a pretext to promote its own hegemonic designs and aggressive agenda in South Asia," he said.
"The Chinese government has already condemned in the strongest terms the outrageous actions of the Indian government to introduce nuclear weapons in South Asia which has destabilized the strategic balance in our region." Pakistan has been for several months under tremendous pressure by the Western countries to ink the CTBT before the sanctions are lifted.
