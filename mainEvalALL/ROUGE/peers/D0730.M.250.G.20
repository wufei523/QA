Once the president has exercised a line-item veto, the final law would not be the same as the measure approved by Congress.

The court said that type of line-item veto can be authorized only through a constitutional amendment.
WASHINGTON, October 14 ( Xinhua ) U.S. President Bill Clinton today used his line-item veto authority to have trimmed 144 million U.S. dollars from a 248 billion dollars defense spending bill.
The line-item veto law was challenged by New York City and an Idaho potato growers' group after U.S. President Bill Clinton vetoed provisions they sought that were granted by Congress.
Congress enacted the veto in 1996, and Clinton used it 82 times last year.
Now, however, it is clear that the line-item veto has resulted in a significant shift in the balance of power to the president, changing the way lawmakers sought funding for favored spending programs.
Thursday's 6-3 decision said the law violates a stipulation in the U.S. Constitution that requires every bill passed by the Congress to be presented to the president for his signature of approval or veto.
Clinton's use of the line-item veto is likely to generate an angry reaction from some in Congress, where military construction projects have long been designed to benefit the home districts of specific congressmen and senators.
