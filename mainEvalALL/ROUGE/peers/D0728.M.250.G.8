Di Bisceglie said the antiviral drug interferon had reduced symptoms in up to 20 percent of patients with hepatitis C who were treated for six months.
Currently, the the only approved treatment is interferon alpha, which can cause flu-like side effects.
One, led by researchers at the Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation in La Jolla, Calif., found that six months after treatment, a combination of interferon and a drug called ribavirin was 31 to 38 percent effective among patients being treated for the first time.
The combination, Rebetron, made by Schering-Plough, reduced the virus to undetectable levels in about twice as many patients as interferon did.
nn Even when it worked, Rebetron was not considered a cure, and it had terrible side effects, including anemia, depression, suicidal thoughts and severe flu-like symptoms.
Schering-Plough is the maker of Intron A and Rebetol, the drugs used together _ at a cost of about $300 a week _ to rid the body of the chronic C virus in some patients.
Fisher's Specialized Pharmacy Services in Pittsburgh has announced plans to fill prescriptions nationwide for the anti-viral drug ribavirin, used by growing numbers of hepatitis C patients in combination with the drug interferon.
The ribavirin-interferon combination generates a lasting response in fewer than half of those who try it, often at the cost of serious side effects.
The standard treatment is the drug interferon or a combination of interferon and ribavirin.
Some doctors and patient groups have criticized Schering-Plough for refusing to "unbundle" the
