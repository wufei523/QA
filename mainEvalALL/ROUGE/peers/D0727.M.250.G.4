Gingrich filed for divorce July 19, 1999, six months after resigning the 6th District seat he held in Congress for 20 years, and from the speakership he won in 1994 after leading House Republicans to their first majority in 40 years.
Mrs Gingrich also wants to question Callista Bisek, a congressional aide to whom Gingrich has been romantically linked.
In one of the more significant developments of the day, a Washington judge issued an order that puts Marianne Gingrich, 48, a step closer to questioning Callista Bisek, 33, under oath about Bisek's relationship with Newt Gingrich, 56.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randolph Evans, denied the allegation and said Marianne Gingrich has always handled the couple's money.
And in most cases, Gingrich seeks financial documents dating back to 1987, when the couple signed a separation agreement splitting their possessions during a spat Gingrich says lasted six years.
In her counterclaim to Gingrich's July 29 divorce petition, Marianne Gingrich accuses her husband of transferring ``substantial portions of certain valuable assets'' before filing for divorce.
Earlier this month, the Gingriches reached an agreement on how to temporarily split their assets until the divorce is final.
Newt Gingrich's business attorney, Randy Evans, said the former US House speaker is ready to split all current assets with his wife and pay her alimony.
The agreement gives Mrs Gingrich the couple's house in Marietta, Ga, and Gingrich their Washington apartment.
