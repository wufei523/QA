NEW YORK _ ABC News said Monday that a report challenging the assumed benefits of organic food was partly based on research that did not exist.
It said it would make a correction on Friday night's ``20/20'' program.
In the report, the correspondent John Stossel said research commissioned by ABC News showed that conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide residue than did organic produce.
``Our tests, surprisingly, found no pesticide residue on the conventional samples or the organic,'' he said in the report first broadcast on Feb. 4 and again on July 7.
But the two researchers who were commissioned to do the testing _ Dr. Michael Doyle, a scientist with the University of Georgia, and Dr. Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never tested produce for pesticide residue for ABC.
In a statement released Monday night, ABC confirmed that pesticide tests were never performed on produce.
But it steered blame away from Stossel.
``In making that statement, Mr. Stossel was relying on inaccurate information that had been provided to him,'' it said.
Executives said David Fitzpatrick, producer of the segment, was responsible for the error, and they were trying to determine how it appeared.
But, they said, they believed it was an honest mistake and did not think Fitzpatrick would be disciplined.
Stossel will make the correction.
