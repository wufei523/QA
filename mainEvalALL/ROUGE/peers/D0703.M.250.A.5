Romanian bankers and economists could not be indifferent to the future of Euro in the international payment system and as a reserve currency, the evolution of the Euro-Dollar exchange rate, the relations which will be established between the national currency Leu and Euro, or Euro's effect on Romanian commercial and payments balance, Isarescu said at a Wednesday colloquium on Euro by the Romanian Society of Economics.
BONN, April 2 - Despite skepticism about the actual realization of a single European currency as scheduled on January 1, 1999, preparations for the design of the Euro note have already begun.
The Frankfurt-based body said in its annual report released today that it has decided on two themes for the new currency: history of European civilization and abstract or concrete paintings.
The Euro is expected to have seven notes with face values ranging from five to 500.
The institute requires the design of the Euro to include five languages of the European Union together with the symbol of the EU - 12 stars in a ring.
