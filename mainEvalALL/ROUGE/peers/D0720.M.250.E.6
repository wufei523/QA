It was the historical signing of the Declaration of Principles in Washington four years ago that formally triggered off the Oslo peace process, named for the Norwegian capital where peace was initiated in secret meetings.
However, the process, which has borne fruits including the Palestinian autonomy in Gaza Strip and West Bank, received a severe blow when the hardline Likud government came to power in Israel last year.
Israel's continuation of settlement activities, land confiscation and delay in troop redeployments have virtually halted the whole process and led to renewed tensions with the Palestinians.
Netanyahu opposes unilateral Palestinian statehood declaration, threatening to annex parts of the West Bank now under Israeli control.
The peace process could only be moved forward through negotiations, he said, adding that no unilateral actions could help.
Meanwhile, he said that Israel could not accept the resolution adopted by the United Nations Human Rights Commission Tuesday in Geneva, which calls for Palestinian self-determination on the basis of the U.N. partition resolution 181 adopted in 1947.
Under the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement signed last January, Israel should have finished the first two stages of the three-phased redeployment by September last year.
But Israel has delayed the move due to a dispute over the scope of redeployment.
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators concluded their talks in Washington Friday, without achieving any breakthrough in breaking the deadlock in the peace process.
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross would also participate, Israel Radio said.
