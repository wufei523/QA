By buying the property, Hawthorne Savings can sell it privately for a much higher price.
It also eliminates any excess money that would have been used to pay part of a 33.5 million dollars civil judgment against Simpson.

The academy charges $13,000 annually, has an average class size of 14 students and sends almost all of its graduates to college.

''My major concern was the education of my kids,'' Simpson said.
Butterfield Butterfield auction house on Sunset Boulevard conducts the live bidding process for Simpson property seized to help settle the $25 million civil judgment won by the families of murder victims Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson.
Online and incognito, the auction is accessible through LiveBid.com ( http://www.livebid.com ) as well as Yahoo!
Auctions ( http://auctions.yahoo.com ).
``We're going to destroy this O.J.
Simpson property on the steps of the L.A.(Criminal) Courthouse (Wednesday) at noon,'' said Bob Enyart, a representative of the Web site, shadowgov.com of Denver.
Enyart said the group, which spent $4,750 for two football jerseys, had planned for two weeks to buy and destroy these items.
Jeff Mohr, 43, of North Hollywood said it appeared many people were drawn to the auction by morbid curiosity.
