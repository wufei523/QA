WASHINGTON - Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and a congressional aide named in his divorce case are trying to keep lawyers for Gingrich's wife from finding out details of their relationship.
Randy Evans, Gingrich's lawyer, said Georgia divorce law limits each side to 50 questions, and with the 32 questions and their subparts Mrs. Gingrich's lawyers posed more than 150.
Newt Gingrich and Marianne Gingrich will try to reach a divorce settlement today in their first face-to-face meeting since theirsplit.
Newt Gingrich's attorney, Randy Evans, says Marianne Gingrich has refused to even discuss a settlement until she questions Bisek.
The Thursday hearing was expected to attract national media, whose reporting has been stoked by Newt Gingrich's relationship with a 33-year-old congressional aide, Callista Bisek of Virginia.
By avoiding a hearing, the Gingriches also avoid answering specific charges they've made against each other since Newt Gingrich filed for the divorce in July.
Marianne Gingrich hasn't said what her terms for settlement would be.
The Gingrich divorce so far has included a number of smaller fights over money, information and the testimony of Bisek.
A lawyer for Newt Gingrich says the former U.S. House speaker and his wife have signed a final divorce settlement and are ready to take the agreement to a Cobb County courtroom.
