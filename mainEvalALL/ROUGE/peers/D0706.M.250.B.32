Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi offered Thursday to end her road side standoff with the military government if the government agrees to release jailed members of her political party.
The government avoids saying it has detained any NLD members.
It claims instead they were "invited" to government guest houses for an exchange of views on convening parliament.
Earlier in the week, a commentary in the state-run New Light of Myanmar signed "Supreme Court Justice" said that Suu Kyi is a British citizen and so the government should deport her.
On the tenth anniversary of the military takeover in Myanmar, about 60 exiled dissidents protested in front of their country's embassy in Bangkok on Friday calling for the release of political prisoners and arrested students.
Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been ruled by the military in various guises since 1962.
The current military government came to power on Sept. 18, 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwide democracy movement.
A World Trade Organization panel is to rule in a dispute between the United States, Europe and Japan over U.S. legislation that bans trade with the military government of Burma.
Forced labor, including child labor, are widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights, the U.S. Labor Department said in a report Monday.
Foreign diplomats and a government official said there were no demonstrations, after warnings from the government and a reported call for calm by the opposition party, the National League for Democracy.
