Attorneys general for some of the states that joined in the government's case said they favored strict sanctions, which might include the breakup of the Microsoft.
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal urged Jackson to ``adopt remedies that are as far-reaching and fundamental as Microsoft's abuses of its monopoly.''
