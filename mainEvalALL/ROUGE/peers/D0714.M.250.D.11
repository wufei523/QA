The surge in sharing and trading music over the Internet has brought online music sites into conflict with record labels, which say copyrighted songs are being pirated.

The battle lines are drawn.
San Francisco -- the crackdown on Napster has reached the corporate workplace.
San Francisco -- in a major victory for the recording industry, a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Napster online music service to stop permitting the exchange of copyrighted music owned by the major music labels.
San Francisco -- Handing the recording industry a resounding victory, a San Francisco judge slapped Napster Inc. with a preliminary injunction Wednesday and ordered the Internet service to halt all illegal song swapping by midnight Friday.
