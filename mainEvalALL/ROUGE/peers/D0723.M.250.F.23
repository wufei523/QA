California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose decision not to run for governor earlier this year came after months of intrigue and public speculation, is leaving no suspense about her plans for re-election to the Senate.
Although no Californian has ever done it, state election officials say Feinstein could run for vice president and Senate at the same time.
In a move that may boost her chances for re-election, Feinstein has reclaimed her seat on the influential Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees $1.5 trillion in annual discretionary spending.
After the Senate voted to acquit Clinton, Feinstein tried to bring up her censure resolution.
Feinstein, whose vote for acquittal was expected, has carved out a major role in the impeachment finale by touting censure as an alternative to conviction.

`We've now established very strongly throughout this country that women have taken a historically unprecedented role in elections,'' Feinstein said.
``She may not have to run a marathon,'' Duffy said of Feinstein's race for re-election, ``but she's going to break a sweat''.
The poll, conducted by Del Ali of Research 2000 in Rockville, Md., showed Feinstein with a formidable 57 percent to 34 percent lead among those who had picked their choice for U.S. Senate if the election were held today.
