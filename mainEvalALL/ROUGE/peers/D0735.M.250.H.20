The 10th Circuit Court's ruling not only ensures that the wolf reintroduction program is safe, it ensures that other wildlife recovery programs can go forward without jeopardy.
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
And for the first time since the reintroductions, wolves have taken up territories well outside Yellowstone Park in the last year.
It was the fifth rare Mexican gray wolf found dead, apparently from a gunshot, since 11 of the animals were released into the wild in a recovery program last spring.
A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the latest killing incomprehensible, and she repeated Babbitt's vow last week that the wolf reintroduction program and the goal of returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next decade will continue.
The National Wildlife Federation said while the proposal reflects the success of wolf recovery programs, it falls far short of a bolder vision for recovery of wolves in the West.
Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves.
When the population is classified as endangered, tighter protections apply and people who oppose the spread of wolves are more likely to resist reintroduction.
The program to restore red wolves suffered a major setback last fall when officials removed the remnants of a group of some 30 animals that had been reintroduced into the Great Smoky Mountains National
