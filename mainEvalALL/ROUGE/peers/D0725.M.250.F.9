It has become clear to the world that Iran, a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty NPT and a member of the Nuclear Disarmament Conference, is not after stockpiling nuclear weapons, Nouri said.
Worried that its leading enemy Iran could acquire nuclear weapons that will threaten its safety, Israel has been launching an aggressive campaign around the world to prevent Tehran from obtaining nuclear technologies needed to build a nuclear bomb.
Expressing concern over the existing nuclear facilities in the Middle East, the two sides urged all regional countries, prior to the establishment of a nuclear-free zone, to show thorough restraint and not to develop, produce, or test nuclear devices.
Khosravi also refuted the recent remarks by a U.S. naval commander on Iran's capability to build nuclear weapons, saying that the International Atomic Energy Agency has consistently confirmed the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programs.
"Despite Iran's location in an area where there are mounting nuclear challenges, the Iranian armed forces do not have any research program on use of nuclear energy for military purposes," Mohammadi said the real goal of Israeli accusations against Iran was to justify its dangerous nuclear capability and its ever growing stock of nuclear arsenal.
For now, officials agree that both India and Pakistan should immediately stop testing nuclear warheads, halt missile tests, end the production of weapons-grade fuel, and join 149 other countries in signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
Iran has long been accused by the U.S. of trying to gain nuclear capability,
