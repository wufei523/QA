BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland is optimistic that China will soon grant a Swiss-based balloon team permission to overfly the country in its quest for the first nonstop round- the-world flight, a foreign ministry spokeswoman said Monday.
The Breitling Orbiter 3 team said last week it had to postpone its attempt due to Chinese irritation over the failure of rivals Steve Fossett, Richard Branson and Per Lindstrand to respect previously agreed conditions.
The Swiss foreign ministry is in constant contact with China and is doing all it can to obtain clearance for pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new partner, Brian Jones of Britain, said ministry spokeswoman Monika Schmutz.
Piccard and Jones, who had obtained conditional permission, had previously said they might take off as soon as Sunday.
It would be Piccard's third attempt to become the first person to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.
MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Swiss-English balloon team soared over Mexico early today after completing a six-day journey across the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to become the first balloonists to travel nonstop around the world.
``So, that little puddle is what they call the Pacific,'' Brian Jones of England deadpanned in a message sent to the team's support crew in Geneva.
``We're pleased that the Pacific is now behind them,'' flight controller Brian Smith said.
They were heading into the Caribbean toward Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti, the control center said in a statement.
The balloonists cruised over Mexico at 53 mph
