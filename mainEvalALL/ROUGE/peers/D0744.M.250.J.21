``I'm very encouraged'' by the government's promises, said Bob Anderson, who runs Walnut Acres in Penn Creek, Penn., and is on the National Organic Standards Board, a coalition of organic farmers.
``There's nothing like 280,000 comments to get the government's attention''.

When a label says ``grown and processed in accordance with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990,'' it does not necessarily mean the food is truly organic, according to the organic foods industry, farmers, inspectors and others.
Products grown and processed according to the standards and contain at least 95 percent organic ingredients will be allowed to carry a seal of approval that says, ''USDA Certified Organic''.
Foods that are least 50 percent organic could be labeled ''made with'' organic ingredients.But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food.
The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried.
