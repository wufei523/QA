The Clinton administration hasn't decided to deploy a national missile defense system, partly because it would violate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with Moscow.
--After six straight failures, a $3.8 billion experimental missile defense system scored its first hit in a test at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, shooting down an incoming test rocket.
-- Iran's weekend test of a long-range missile underscored the need for a U.S. national missile defense system, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday.
The test ''is one of the reasons why it is important for the United States to undertake to research, develop and potentially deploy a national missile defense system that would provide protection against countries such as Iran posing a threat to the United States,'' Cohen said on the last day of a three-day visit to Australia.It was designed to test elements of the national missile defense system -- such as an ''in-flight interceptor communication system'' used to send information from the ground radar to the interceptor missile -- that will be used in the next attempt to shoot down a mock warhead in space.
WASHINGTON _ In a second straight success, an experimental theater missile defense system intercepted a target missile Monday at a New Mexico test site, prompting the Pentagon to predict that the missile will graduate to its second stage of development next year.
