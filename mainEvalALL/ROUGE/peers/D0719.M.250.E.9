Although France's unemployment rate has edged down to around 11.6 percent in recent months, jobless associations have been seeking to rekindle a protest movement which last year led to the occupation of dozens of unemployment offices across the country.
Unemployment in France fell to 11.6 percent in October from 11.7 percent, reflecting a slow but steady improvement in France's high jobless rate, long one of the nation's knottiest problems.
But it predicted that France's unemployment should fall over the medium term due to reduction in cyclical unemployment, while the measures taken in recent years, in particular the reduction of the cost of unskilled labor, should reduce structural unemployment.
France is running a near-record 12.4 percent jobless rate with a jobless population of 3.1 million, one-third of which has been unemployed for more than a year.
France has raised its unemployment benefits by 2.45 percent as of July 1, announced Denis Gautier-Sauvagnac, president of the unemployment insurance regime of UNEDIC.
Groups of jobless occupied unemployment offices in southern France and in one Parisian suburb Tuesday, keeping pressure on the government to give them a year-end bonus of 3,000 francs dlrs 535. While recognizing the social performance of the welfare system of France, the OECD also expressed worry over the high costs of France's social protection system, in particular the high cost of unemployment insurance and unemployment compensation rates.
Protests were staged in some 60 cities throughout the country against a 3 percent rise in unemployment benefits announced by Prime Minister
