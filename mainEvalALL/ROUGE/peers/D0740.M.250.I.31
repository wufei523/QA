The first, in 1997, ended several hours after liftoff when his balloon burst.
Thereafter, the capsule and most of the balloon will be presented to the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop.

Only last week a British balloon, the Cable Wireless, was forced to end a round-the-world attempt, ditching in the Pacific Ocean.
Instead, they scuttled to a stop in the sands of the Sahara, after two aborted attempts, and then had to gouge holes in their still-inflated balloon to keep it from dragging them further across the desolate desert.
There has been an intense but friendly informal competition for the round-the-world title since 1993, using innovative balloon designs.

The support crew in Geneva popped open a bottle of champagne as the balloon approached the Mexican coast.

Their 53-meter-high combined helium and hot-air balloon slowly lifted off at 9:55 a.m.
Unlike Piccard and Jones, though, Uliassi is flying in an unpressurized crew compartment.
