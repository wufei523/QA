Many environmentalists have been calling on the Australian government not to approve the uranium mining project adjacent to the park, but the government rejected their environmental concerns, saying jobs and export income to be generated from the mining project is important.
Hill said Australia's response to the report "clearly demonstrated that there is no basis to including Kakadu National Park on the in-danger list".
The findings of the mission report were inconsistent with the fact the Ranger uranium mine, less than 20 km from Jabiluka had operated for 20 years with no adverse impact on Kakadu.
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed." The finding was hailed by traditional owners and green groups as a great victory, but Environment Minister Robert Hill blasted the report as biased and unbalanced and said the mine would go ahead, according to Australian Associated Press.
Hill denounced the report as biased and unscientific and said Australia would try to have it struck down before it is considered by the World Heritage Committee in Kyoto this week.
He told reporters that exports from Jabiluka are expected to peak at 4,500 tons a year and the mine is expected to add a total of 4.46 billion U.S. dollars to Australia's gross domestic product over 28 years.
The government's decision however has been condemned by environmentalists and opposition parties.
