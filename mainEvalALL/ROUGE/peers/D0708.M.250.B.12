DHAKA, April 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka is going alarmingly dry because of a serious shortage of water supply with no sign of immediate improvement.
Sources from the city's Water and Sewerage Authority (WASA) said its daily water supply at present was about 815 million liters through 205 deep tube-wells, well short of the daily demand of 1.29 billion liters in Dhaka.
Officials concerned noted that the loss of water in the obsolete system and facilities made it even more difficult for WASA to meet the demand.
They said the densely populated old city of Dhaka and its surrounding areas were the worst hit by the water shortage.

Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment Costas Petrides today called for urgent water supply cuts to deal with the severe water shortage which followed a dry winter.
According to the minister, water supply to households will be cut by 20 percent, which means water will be supplied only three days a week, compared with 10 percent last year.
Water for farming purposes will be cut by up to 70 percent compared with 35 percent the year before.
