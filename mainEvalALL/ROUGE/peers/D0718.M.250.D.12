SEATTLE (AP) -- Starbucks Corp. shares tumbled today after the coffee retailer warned that shortfalls in its non-core businesses and the cost of launching a new Internet portal will result in lower than expected earnings for the next two quarters and for the year.
Analysts had estimated the gourmet coffee retailer would earn 60 cents per share for fiscal 1999.
But Starbucks late Wednesday predicted earnings of 54 cents per share, with earnings over the next two quarters coming up 3 cents short of expectations.
Company executives had expected that strong retail sales in Starbucks core coffee business would make up the difference, but that didn't happen, Schultz said.
Schultz said the company plans to create a ``canopy brand'' LOS ANGELES _ Sipping his coffee at the Starbucks restaurant on Melrose Avenue here, Matt Siess said he loved the brew and the atmosphere.
But he is skeptical about the coffee chain's new ambition to sell things beyond drinks and light food.
``I'm not sure what selling coffee has to do with selling Calphalon,'' he said referring to the cookware products.
Like some of its customers, Starbucks investors are skeptical as well about the company's plans, announced late Wednesday, to become an Internet retailer, not just of roasted beans and coffee mugs, but of everything from frying pans to towels, picture frames and even sofas and credenzas.
``They are trying to stretch who they are as a company into an area where they really don't have any expertise,'' said John Ivankoe,
