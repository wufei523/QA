WASHINGTON (AP) -- Newly developed digitalized baseball cards are presenting the Library of Congress with new problems in preserving the nation's heritage.
The world's biggest library -- over 119 million items -- has high-quality housings for its collection of cardboard baseball cards going back more than 100 years, including one that shows Ty Cobb stealing third base.
''Not too hot, not too cold; not too moist, not too dry,'' curator Harry Katz describes the conditions for assuring they don't deteriorate into paper mache or dust.
''It's the same problem as preserving the Gutenberg Bible or Ansel Adams photos, though the parameters are different, depending on the materials''.
But the new digital trading cards on three-inch CD-ROMs will require also preserving what will inevitably become antique computer technology to read them.
''One problem is the hardware,'' Katz said.
''Technology moves so fast that in a few years today's computers may be obsolete.
No use keeping the disks if they can't be read.
How much equipment do we have to preserve, too''?
As society becomes more digitalized, the library is increasingly looking at computer capacity as much as warehouse space in planning its future needs.
''How many gigabytes should you have''?
Katz asked.
Many archives now exist only on the Internet, and it's not just archives.
''A lot of artists -- increasingly -- don't work on paper.
Their work is just images you can see on a monitor,'' Katz said.
