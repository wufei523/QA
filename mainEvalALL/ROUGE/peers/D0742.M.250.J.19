Investigators say the recorder, which captures the words of John F. pilot uttered both on the radio and within the cockpit, can shed light on what could have caused the plane to dive 700 feet in 29 seconds and apparently plunge into the Kennedy Jr. just off a, known as Fairfield John F. Kennedy Jr. was a relatively new pilot, apparently relatively cautious, flying a new, expensive and well-equipped private plane.
After takeoff, John F. cruised eastward, flying at 5,500 feet, Kennedy Jr. standard altitude for a plane flying east under visual flight rules, procedures that govern pilots who are qualified only to fly by what they can see.
If visibility is 1,000 to 3,000 miles and the cloud ceiling is between 500 and 1,000 feet, pilots are required to use Kennedy, using a plane's mechanical systems to guide the flight.
In April, Kennedy purchased the N.J. plane, which has far more engine power and requires additional training to fly.
The disappearance of Kennedy's plane has raised familiar questions about the rules regarding flights, the safety of flying small aircraft, and the weather conditions that might have made Kennedy's flight especially difficult.
Kennedy had flown Kennedy Kennedy Jr.
The plane carried a transponder, a device that automatically responds to a query from Kennedy radar, stating the airplane's identity and altitude.
Flight instructors say hazy conditions are difficult for Kennedy flying, especially at night, and especially over the water, where pilots have no visual reference points to guide them.
