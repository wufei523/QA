The Agriculture Department will rely on state and industry certifiers as it allows producers to use the organic label.
That meat will be the only organic food with a certification process approved by the federal government.
The government has approved approximately 50 varieties of genetically engineered crops, and gene-altered soybeans and corn can be found in foods throughout the supermarket.
Organic farming practices prohibit the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for crops or antibiotics or hormones in livestock.
Among other rules, the regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled ``organic''.
The Agriculture Department first proposed a set of national organic standards in 1997 but withdrew them after farmers and others in the $6 billion-a-year organic industry strongly objected to allowing biotech crops, irradiation and sewage sludge.

When the Agriculture Department proposed national standards for organic food that included genetically altered food, more than 200,000 comments were received protesting the proposed regulations.
