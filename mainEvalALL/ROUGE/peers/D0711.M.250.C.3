The Justice Department has renewed its scrutiny of alleged antitrust violations by the software giant Microsoft Corp.
On Monday in Washington D.C., the federal government and 20 states kicked off the trial that accused Microsoft of illegal activities, including bullying competitors.
But the allegations in the government's antitrust suit do include the practices that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case Sun filed against Microsoft last October _ namely, that Microsoft is trying to pollute Sun's Internet programming language, called Java, by modifying it.
Most countries investigating Microsoft's practices were taking a wait-and-see stance toward the company, pending the outcome of the major U.S. antitrust case.
Microsoft attorney James Jardine says key Microsoft lawyers will need time to prepare for the Caldera trial once the federal antitrust case concludes.
Ever since IBM selected Microsoft to supply the operating system for the first IBM PC in 1981, IBM has been out-hustled and outsmarted by Microsoft in the PC business _ not the sort of behavior the nation's antitrust laws were meant to prohibit.
If this weren't enough for Microsoft, the company faces another antitrust shootout in a case that has attracted far less attention but could be equally devastating to Microsoft's future.
Under the schedule set by Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial.
