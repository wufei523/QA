At a news conference in Andrews, N.C., Tuesday afternoon, federal investigators said that the team of agents pursuing Eric Robert Rudolph would be more than doubled from its previous size of 35.
Killorin joined in a chorus of federal officials Wednesday in saying that Nordmann is not considered to have been aiding Rudolph in eluding capture.
Armstead would not, however, say whether agents are any closer to capturing Rudolph.
During a news conference, Enderson was pressed on why federal law enforcement officers haven't named Rudolph a suspect or charged him with the July 1996 deadly pipe-bomb explosion in Centennial Olympic Park, the January 1997 double blast at a Sandy Springs abortion clinic or a February 1997 bomb at an Atlanta gay nightclub.
In announcing the new charges, federal officials solicited the public's help in capturing Rudolph.
About 100 investigative officers from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and local sheriffs departments are hunting for fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph in the 530,000-acre Nantahala National Forest, a rugged area at the state's western tip.
Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic.
Sitting under a tree silently waiting for a target, Eric Farley said he suspected Rudolph is in the forest, maybe even close by.
An off-duty police officer died in the Alabama clinic bombing and a nurse was permanently maimed, and to many people, those human losses should not be forgotten in the saga
