LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J.
Simpson memorabilia went up in flames to a chorus of cheers and boos Wednesday, a day after it was sold at auction to help pay off the $33.5 million judgment he owes in the deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend.
Two No. 32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased $16,000 worth of items.
The auction Tuesday raised $430,000, including $255,500 for Simpson's Heisman Trophy.
``We are destroying O.J.
Simpson's property in front of the L.A. courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying justice before our very eyes,'' protest organizer Bob Enyart of Denver said.
The prices surprised some collectors because Simpson sports memorabilia hasn't been selling well.
LOS ANGELES -- O.J.
Simpson's Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched $230,000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the families of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman.
The total amount raised by the sale of 74 items was $430,000, but the families of the two slaying victims will receive only about $382,000 once auction house fees and other costs are subtracted.
``The amount collected today won't even put a scratch in the $33.5 million judgment,'' said attorney Michael D. Myers, the state court receiver appointed to oversee the liquidation of Simpson's property.
I'm a Heisman Trophy winner,'' said Cohen, a real estate
