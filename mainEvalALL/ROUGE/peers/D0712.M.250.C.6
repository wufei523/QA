India prevented me from going to India," Rushdie said in a recent interview published in the latest issue of Sunday, a weekly magazine.
Bocker prize winner Rushdie had been living a furtive life since 1989 under police protection in Britain following a death sentence issued by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini for blaspheming Islam in his book the Satanic Verses.
Iran announced a lifting of the death sentence on September 24 this year.
On February 14, 1989, the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, announcing the death sentence of Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest at the publication of his novel, and exhorting all Muslims to carry out the sentence.
Since then, the Rushdie issue has turned into a big controversial problem that hinders the relations between Iran and European countries.
However, Iran, given tremendous pressures from the European Union (EU) after the death of Khomeini, has promised not to dispatch any commandos to kill Rushdie.
"The question is not whether but how to withdraw from previous position, in such a way that Iran will not lose face both at home and abroad," he said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati reiterated here last week that Iran would not send anyone to kill the author.
Mostafa Mirsalim, Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance, said at a press conference held last week that Iran will take the case of insulting religious sanctities like the Rushdie affair to the United Nations.
