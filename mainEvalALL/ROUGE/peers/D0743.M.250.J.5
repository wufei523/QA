ANKARA, August 22 - Another strong earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 struck western Turkey on Sunday, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
The agency quoted officials of Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory as saying that the quake, which happened in Sakarya ( Adapazari ), was confimed as an aftershock following the devastating earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale on August 17.
Over 60 aftershocks measuring at least 4.0 on the Richter scale have occurred since the quake hit western Turkey in the early hours of August 17.
ISTANBUL ( Turkey ), August 21 - Blaze in a refinery in western Turkey has been under control after the strong efforts made by foreign rescue experts, a Turkish official said on Saturday.
ISTANBUL, Turkey - Turkey's prime minister has promised stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's massive earthquake.
Meanwhile, eight days after the powerful 7.4-magnitude temblor reduced a wide swath of western Turkey to rubble, searchers said they still held out hopes - though slim - that more people could be found alive.
Despite rescue efforts like the one today in Cinarcik, the search for survivors was winding down.
