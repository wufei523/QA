Being overweight has been strongly associated with greater risk of certain illnesses, including heart disease, high cholesterol and blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and some cancers.
CDC Director Jeffrey P. Koplan said a national strategy is needed to combat obesity.
He called for workplaces offer healthier foods and exercise facilities, more sidewalks and bike paths, and encouraging children to play outdoors instead of watching TV or using computers.
Risks are even greater among those who are severely obese.
Published in the October issue of the American Journal of Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among persons who are overweight or obese.
The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.
According to researchers from St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, both lean and obese subjects who were injected with leptin lost significant amounts of weight during the trial of the hormone, compared to other participants injected with an inert placebo.
Moreover, the longer the study went on, the more weight the 100 participants lost.
The weight lost was almost entirely fat, as opposed to muscle tissue.
Among healthy, non-smoking white men and women and black men, the researchers found a gradually increasing risk of death beginning with a BMI of 25, which is 150 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman and 174 pounds for a 5-foot-10 man.
