The Recording Industry Association of America, which represents major record labels, and several music groups have argued that software created by the online music start-up Napster permits individuals to steal copyrighted material.
At the behest of the recording industry, US District Judge Marilyn Patel last month issued a sweeping injunction against Napster, where millions of music lovers swap digital copies of their favorite tunes without paying for them.
The lawsuit charges Napster with violating the rights of recording artists whose songs are traded freely on the site.
The Recording Industry Association of America estimates that Napster has already cost more than $300 million in lost sales.
``This decision will pave the way for the future of online music,'' said Cary Sherman, general counsel for the Recording Industry Association of America, the trade group representing the top five record labels that sued Napster for copyright infringement in December.
Napster created software that allows people to share and swap MP3-formatted songs over the Internet without paying for the music.
Napster supporters, such as Public Enemy singer Chuck D, champion the site for offering artists without major-label deals or radio play a chance to get heard.
But the major record companies along with rock band Metallica and rap star Dr Dre have sued Napster claiming the program promotes music piracy and cheats artists out of royalties.
The heavy-metal band Metallica will seek to prevent 335,000 fans from using Napster, a service for sharing music collections over the Internet.
