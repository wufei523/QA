On February 14, 1989, late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a religious edict, pronouncing a death sentence on the Indian-born British author Salman Rushdie and his publishers in protest against the publication of Rushdie's novel "The Satanic Verses," which was believed by Moslems as defaming Islam, and exhorting all Moslems to carry out the sentence.
Iran announced here today that it drops the death sentence on Salman Rushdie, a British writer accused of defaming Islam in his novel, under tremendous pressure from European countries.
Although the Iranian government has said in the past that it would not actively encourage anyone to kill Rushdie, it has never explicitly revoked the death sentence, nor canceled the bounty.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is the only person who has the authority to cancel the death sentence on Salman Rushdie.
An Iranian foundation has added dlrs 300,000 to the reward for Salman Rushdie's death, just weeks after the Iranian government tried to distance itself from the bounty.
The move follows the Iranian government's distancing itself last month from bounties offered for the death of Rushdie and a strong reaction by hard-liners who support the killing of the Booker Prize-winning author.
Salman Rushdie says his life has improved since Iran distanced itself last year from a death sentence against him.
British author Salman Rushdie said Thursday that it appeared his nearly 10-year ordeal had ended.
British Airways said Friday that it would not permit the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes.
