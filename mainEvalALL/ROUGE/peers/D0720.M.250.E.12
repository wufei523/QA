GAZA CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat has warned that the failure of the signed Palestinian-Israeli peace accords will lead the region to violence.
He said the Palestinians are seeking peace -- but with several options all open in resisting the abhorred Israeli occupation.
The collapse of the (signed peace) accords...
will return the region to the circle of violence," he said.
"The basic rule to push forward the peace process," he said, "only requires the honest implementation of the accords and adherence to land-for-peace principle, in line with international legitimate resolutions, especially Security Council resolution 242 and 338".
He also criticized Israel for its "unjust blockade" of Palestinian areas, including the prevention of the entry of goods and obstruction of the free movement of the Palestinian people.
JERUSALEM, May 24 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat emphasized Sunday in Gaza that Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, according to the Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
Upon his arrival from Cairo, Arafat said that even under the Oslo Accords, Jerusalem is part of the occupied land, and Israel should commit itself to all obligations of peace and respect the signed agreements.
Arafat also urged the United States to announce its peace initiative concerning Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank in order to put more pressure on the Israeli government to live up to its contractual obligations.
Meanwhile, a large number of extremist Jewish demonstrators are gathering near the Kattanin Gate
