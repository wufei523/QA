Turkish monster earthquake measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale has caused about 20 billion U.S. dollars in economic loss, accounting for half of the country's budget in 1999.
From the streets to government offices, earthquake relief workers and international agencies Friday pleaded with Turkey to turn its attention from the more than 10,000 dead and 35,000 missing from Tuesday's disaster to the hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless, many at risk of disease.
The number of casualties may still increase as the rescue workers are continuing sifting through piles of rubble of the collapsed buildings in the tremor-hit cities in search for survivors and the bodies of the dead.
Although rescue workers continued to find people alive under the rubble of collapsed buildings, the death toll climbed steadily: By Wednesday night, according to an official count, 3,879 bodies had been recovered.
Some 26,000 survivors of the August 17, 1999 earthquake that devastated Izmit, Turkey's western industrial heartland in Marmara region, are still living in tents one year after the quake.
Turkish private NTV quoted Ismail Alakoc as saying that the strong fire of the Izmit Refinery in Kocaeli province caused by Tuesday's monster earthquake has been under control with the help of foreign countries.
Turkey's prime minister has promised stricter building rules to prevent any more of the shoddy construction blamed for the thousands of deaths from last week's massive earthquake.
