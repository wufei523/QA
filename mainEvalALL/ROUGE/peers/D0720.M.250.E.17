Over 10,000 Israeli peace activists gathered in Tel Aviv overnight to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the signing of Oslo Accords and protest the Likud government's policies.
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N. resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and the will of the international community.
A senior Palestinian National Authority official, in January 1998, urged Israel to implement the Oslo accords and the Hebron agreement in a bid to move the Mideast peace process forward.
Egypt interpreted the Netanyahu proposal as an attempt to annul the land-for-peace principle set by the Madrid conference and the Oslo accords that Israel signed with the Palestinians.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has turned down an invitation to attend a meeting in Norway next week to mark the fifth anniversary of the Oslo Accords.
When the historic Oslo Accords were signed in Washington, on September 13, 1998, five years ago, the Palestinians were promised land and the Israelis peace.
That's the only path to peace the Oslo Accords envisioned five years ago.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, in October 1998, that the interim deal he struck with the Palestinians was unlike the Oslo Accords, which he said were not good agreements.
Erekat noted that what the Palestinians want is an assurance from the U.S. that the Israeli third withdrawal from the West Bank, outlined in the Oslo accords signed by the two sides in 1993, would be carried out.
