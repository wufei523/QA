Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard announced Wednesday that he has chosen Brian Jones as his teammate for his next attempt at circling the world in a balloon.
Jones, 52, replaces fellow British flight engineer Tony Brown.
Achieving what promoters called the last great milestone of aviation, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones joined legends like the Wright Brothers and Charles Lindbergh with Saturday's completion of the first manned round-the-world balloon flight.
At 4:54 a.m. EST Saturday, the two balloonists crossed the line of longitude from which they had departed on March 1 at Chateau D'Oex, Switzerland, officially earning them the long-sought title of the first balloon circumnavigation of the globe, as well as a $1 million prize.
The two men, Bertrand Piccard and Wim Verstraeten, were rescued by French helicopters in the Mediterranean where their balloon landed because fuel from the heating system had leaked into the cabin, according to a report by Swiss Radio International.
It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot a balloon around the world.
The balloon's route should take it across the Mediterranean Sea, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China and Japan before crossing the Pacific and North America and returning to Europe, a three-week journey of some 26,700 kilometers ( 16,600 miles ).
