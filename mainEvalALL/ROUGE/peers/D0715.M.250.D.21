_ Jordan signed a global land mine treaty Saturday, joining 127 other countries that have endorsed the pact, which prohibits the use, production and stockpiling of the weapon.
More than 120 countries signed the treaty, known as the Ottawa Convention, in the Canadian capital in December, but it needs to be ratified by 40 countries to take effect.
```Our task now is to persuade those countries to sign without further delay, and to remove the millions of mines already laid across the world''.
The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty, maintaining such weapons are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea from invading South Korea.
In a statement, the ICBL expressed ``grave concern about reports of the continued laying of mines in a number of countries that have signed but not ratified the treaty, such as Angola, Cambodia, Senegal and Sudan.
With a land mine treaty ratified in record time, they want every nation to sign it and the millions of land mines that continue to kill, maim and sow terror around the world removed.
In a survey completed last April, the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, reported that governments or rebel groups in at least 13 countries had used mines in the 15 months after the treaty was signed, though before it officially went into force.
