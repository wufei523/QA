The discovery of a pickup truck believed to have been stolen by Eric Robert Rudolph prompted federal investigators to double their force here and to hint that they could be close to finding the fugitive sought in the bombing of a Birmingham abortion clinic and three Atlanta bombings.
The manhunt intensified again for abortion clinic bombing suspect Eric Rudolph after authorities said he took a truck and a six-month supply of food from a home last week.
Rudolph's truck was seen leaving the area of the Birmingham bombing, and the fugitive disappeared Jan. 30 into the western North Carolina mountains.
Monday that they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but they aren't ruling him out, either.
Rudolph has also been charged with the July 27, 1996, bombing at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta; the Jan. 16, 1997, bombing of a north Atlanta building that includes an abortion clinic, and the Feb. 21, 1997, bombing of an Atlanta nightclub with a large gay clientele.
Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in Atlanta, in which a woman died.
Federal law enforcement agents have searched for Rudolph since shortly after the Jan. 29, 1998 bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in the 1998, explosion that killed a policeman and maimed a nurse at a clinic that performs abortions in Birmingham, Ala.
