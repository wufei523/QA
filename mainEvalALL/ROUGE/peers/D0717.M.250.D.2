Shares of American Home Products Corp. fell sharply on Friday after a ruling by a federal judge that could allow patients in up to 44 states to collectively sue the company for the cost of monitoring their health after they took two diet drugs, known as fen-phen.
The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement meetings.
American Home Products Corp. agreed late Tuesday to pay $350 million to settle 1,400 injury cases brought in Mississippi over its diet drug combination fen-phen, a liability that could endanger the company's proposed $70 billion merger with Warner-Lambert.
A judge on Monday declared a mistrial after attorneys determined they couldn't seat an impartial jury to hear Debbie Stone Lovett's case against American Home Products Inc. and subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.
American Home is accused of deliberately downplaying the risks of the two fen drugs, both of which were removed from the market in September 1997 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration after they were linked to heart valve problems, a condition Smith did not have.
American Home Products moved to settle the cases after a Mississippi jury had awarded $150 million in compensatory damages to five plaintiffs, four of whom said the drugs had caused them to develop primary pulmonary hypertension, an often fatal lung illness.
Nearly 6 million people took fen-phen
