A jury had found McKinney guilty Wednesday of felony murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
According to the agreement, McKinney will serve two consecutive life sentences, one for felony murder and one for kidnapping.
President Bill Clinton praised the jurors' decision, saying "this verdict is a dramatic statement that we are determined to have a tolerant law-abiding nation that celebrates our differences, rather than deepening them." One of two men accused in the slaying, Aaron McKinney, 22, goes on trial Monday on charges of first-degree murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery.
The other suspect, Russell Henderson, 22, pleaded guilty in April to felony murder and kidnapping and received two life sentences.
Shepard, 21, was lured from a bar Oct. 7, 1998, driven to a remote prairie, tied to a fence, pistol-whipped into unconsciousness and left to die on the freezing plains.
The California Department of Justice said 10 people had been murdered in the state between 1995 and 1997 as a result of hate crimes, although a number for gay-related murders was not available.
There were 112 gay-related hate crimes, none of them murders, in San Francisco last year, according to the city Hate Crimes Unit.
Prompted in part by the murder of Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyo., last year, more than 450 bills have been introduced in legislatures around the country this year on issues important to gays and lesbians.
