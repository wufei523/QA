The sidekicks taking center stage include Estelle Harris, who played George's mother; Wayne Knight, Newman; Phil Morris, Jackie Chiles; and Patrick Warburton, Puddy.
The family is appalled by the behavior of Jessica and Jerry Seinfeld.
The next, he's resurrecting his recurring Seinfeld character, a trigger-happy lawyer named Jackie Chiles, to star in an NBC sitcom executive-produced by Jerry Seinfeld and Seinfeld co-creator Larry David.
While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the ending of the phenomenal run of Seinfeld after 140 episodes, he's relieved it's over.
Seinfeld has vowed that he willn't do another TV series, but he is going to perform, one final time, the stand-up comedy act he developed throughout his career.
This is an incest-themed story line that showed up on Seinfeld but that David was taping two weeks for his new show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, starting on HBO.
It was during those struggling stand-up days in New York when David and Seinfeld became friends.
There was some hugging at the end of the show.
Variety estimates that all Seinfeld syndication deals to date have bumped the show's overall gross to much more than $1.5 billion.
