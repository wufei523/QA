Obesity is a U.S. epidemic that has surged in the past decade and now affects nearly one in five adults, killing some 300,000 a year, a collection of new studies suggest.
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by medical professionals and has been established by the American Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
For the first time, the guidelines emphasize physical activity, recommending at least 30 minutes of daily exercise for adults and 60 minutes for children.
Schools need to schedule more activity for youngsters, and children need to be encouraged to eat low-calorie, low-fat foods too.
If exercise levels remain equal, that translates into a weight gain of 15 pounds a year, according to the National Institutes of Health.
U.S. fat intake has dropped in the last 20 years from an average of 40 percent to 33 percent of calories consumed, the average daily calorie intake has risen from 1,854 to 2,002.
That helps explain why the number of overweight adult Americans continues to grow.
Several genetic defects have already been found that increase the tendency to put on weight.
The study, the largest ever done on obesity and mortality, found that overweight people run a higher rate of premature death.
The researchers calculated each subject's body mass index, or BMI, a ratio of weight to height, and tracked them for age and cause of death.
