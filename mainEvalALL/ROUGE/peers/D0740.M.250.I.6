Their Cable and Wireless balloon, which launched from Spain on Feb. 17, has broken balloon endurance records for time aloft.
Prescot and Elson have been painstakingly negotiating the winds of North Africa, the Indian subcontinent and south Asia to avoid being drawn into China, which has denied them permission to fly through its air space.
An Anglo-Swiss team of balloonists, meanwhile, picked up altitude and speed over Africa's Sahara Desert after chipping off icicles that weighed down the craft and wasted fuel.
The center said the speed helped conserve propane, which fuels the burners in the lower, hot-air section of the balloon.
The burners are needed to keep the balloon afloat.
The center said it still is unable to predict where the balloon will land if it reaches North Africa, but that it probably won't make it as far as the pyramids, where Jones had hoped to come down Sometimes the balloon crawled at 20 miles an hour, but in stretches where the crew could exploit jet streams, the Breitling sped at more than 100 miles an hour.
On two occasions, prompted partly by the need to scrape ice off burners and partly to escape the bad-smelling air inside the crew capsule, the balloonists ventured outside their pressurized crew compartment into the frigid, thin air above 20,000 feet.
Wednesday, Piccard reported that he and Jones had been having trouble sleeping.
