Shell International plans to invest 40 billion to 60 billion U.S. dollars in deep water oil exploration along the west African coast in the next 20 years.
Shell has already started its deep water exploration in Nigeria through the Shell Nigeria Exploration Company Limited.
"What we've basically done is putting a drilling rig on the sea ice, then drilled through the ice and water and then finally 400 meters into the seabed.
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or more below the seabed.
Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica.
Oil companies operating in Nigeria have achieved encouraging results in deep water oil exploration although a total of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars was spent between 1993 and 1998.
