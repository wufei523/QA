The federal and state wolf program has changed its approach in its second year after criticism from ranchers and other local residents.
Five packs with more than two dozen wolves are in eastern Arizona's wilderness as part of the reintroduction program.
Ranchers and state farm bureaus oppose the 5-year-old program because they say the wolves endanger livestock.
They also claim that the program is unnecessary because there is already a viable wolf population in the area.
The farm groups said the reintroduction program violates the Endangered Species Act by providing different protections to the native and the reintroduced wolves.
Van Putten said there is a thriving population of about 300 wolves in Yellowstone and central Idaho as a result of the reintroduction program.
Babbitt dismissed many of the problems as necessary growing pains for a new program.
The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf.
Babbitt said the wolf program goes beyond building bridges with the local community.
Ironically, recent studies of wolves in Yellowstone National Park show the one way to effectively remove coyotes is the reintroduction of wolves.
Before the season began, wildlife officials had mailed brochures explaining the wolf-recovery program to the 6,000 hunters who had permits to hunt dear, elk, bear and mountain lions in the wolf area.
The wolf release program was opposed by the ranching associations of New Mexico and Arizona, the governors of both states and by votes of county commissioners in 11 counties.
