The man identified as the shooter, Mark Barton, was a day trader.
As authorities continued to investigate a three-day killing spree that left 13 people dead, including Barton, even his mother said she couldn't fathom what transformed the 44-year-old chemist-turned-day trader into the worst mass murderer in Georgia history.
Day traders typically work out of places like All-Tech Investment Group and Momentum Securities, the Atlanta businesses where Barton traded.
Barton, a chemist and securities day trader, wrote in his letter that he killed his current wife, Leigh Ann, on Tuesday night and his two children, 11-year-old Matthew and 8-year-old Mychelle, on Wednesday night.
A KILLING SPREE LEAVES A TRAIL OF BODIES IN GEORGIA A 44-year-old independent stock trader went on a shooting rampage in Atlanta, killing 9 people at two office buildings before killing himself as the police tried to arrest him.
Barton is believed to have started his killing spree in Georgia on the day that his account at one day trading firm, Momentum Securities, ran out of money with losses of more than $105,000.
Several of the day traders killed or injured in the Buckhead shootings had lent Barton money to pay off numerous debts, according to Atlanta police.
On July 29, 1999, a year ago next Saturday, the 44-year-old day trader tore through two stock brokerages in the Atlanta financial district on the worst killing spree in Georgia's history.
Many of them came together to share their experiences at a memorial service in a suburban Atlanta church
