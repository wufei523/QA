Among other rules, the regulations will prohibit the use of genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation in the production of food products labeled ``organic''.
Antibiotics in organic livestock production and feed will also be banned.
The regulations, first introduced in 1997, will make it easier for organic farmers to export their products because international trade officials prefer to deal with one national standard rather than multiple state and private standards.
1998: Organic farmers, processors, marketers, chefs and consumers send more than 280,000 protest letters, prompting U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to withdraw a proposal to allow food to be labeled ``organic'' even if it is irradiated to kill germs, genetically engineered, or fertilized with treated sewage sludge.

His real goal, he said, is to prevent organic agriculture from becoming the norm.
``My big concern is that we do not have room on the planet to feed ourselves organically,'' he said.
