ANDREWS, N.C.
(AP) -- It was a year ago that serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph slipped through a police dragnet, loaded up on food and gear at an acquaintance's home and vanished into the rugged Southern Appalachians.
``All that's left up here are some investigators,'' said Macon County Deputy Kenny Cope, who knew Rudolph when they were growing up and later helped search for him.
Rudolph has been charged in three Atlanta-area bombings, including the 1996 Olympic park bombing in which a woman died.
Investigators also suspect he was involved in a January 1998 explosion that killed a police officer and maimed a nurse at the New Woman All Women Health Care clinic in Birmingham, Ala.
Task force leaders said Rudolph watched local resident George Nordmann's ridgetop home 10 miles east of town for several days before approaching it on July 7, 1998, to take some food.
He left $500 and drove off in the truck.
ANDREWS, N.C.
_ An old pickup truck federal investigators believe was stolen almost two weeks ago by Birmingham bomb suspect Eric Robert Rudolph was driven a ''few dozen miles'' over four days before it was abandoned in a remote Nantahala camp site, the head of the Southeast Bomb Task Force said Wednesday.
Experts examined the engine and other parts trying to determine a radius for the search for the fugitive, who may have used the 1977 Datsun truck to transport food and provisions to a hideout, investigators said.
