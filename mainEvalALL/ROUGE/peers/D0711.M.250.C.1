Legal experts gave the judge in the Microsoft case high marks Thursday for his handling of the case, saying he took some risks but grounded his ruling in fundamental principles governing fair competition.
They said the actions of the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, had made it more difficult for Microsoft to suggest that the computer industry ought to be given more leeway than traditional businesses under antitrust law.
``It reminds people that there are antitrust laws out there,'' said George A. Hay, a professor of antitrust law at Cornell Law School.
``It is a useful reminder that there are rules and just because you are big you can't do whatever you want''.
The risks for Jackson in the ruling, the legal experts said, included his decision to deny Microsoft new hearings on whether to break up the company or impose some lesser remedy after he had decided it abused its monopoly power.
Some experts said appeals courts might overturn that decision and could order new hearings.
But several antitrust experts said the judge made efforts throughout the case to tie his decisions to traditional views of antitrust law, which is based on the principle that aggressive competition is encouraged, but not when it crosses the line into efforts to hamper competitors' abilities to make new products or market existing ones.
The judge said in an earlier ruling that Microsoft had maintained its dominance by keeping ``an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune''.
