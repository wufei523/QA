The Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a law giving the president a line-item veto, which let him cancel specific items in tax and spending measures.
Clinton has used the line-item veto to rewrite 11 laws, eliminating 82 items, including money for New York City hospitals and a tax break for Idaho potato growers.
In February, a US District Court here ruled the line-item veto unconstitutional, saying Congress violated the Constitution's separation of powers clause by delegating such authority to the president.
In his argument for the Clinton administration, US Solicitor General Seth Waxman contended that a line-item veto would not actually repeal part of a law but would be a presidential exercise of spending authority.
The justices considered the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act, which went into effect in January 1997.
The Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the Constitution prohibited the president from rewriting legislation by vetoing single items of spending or tax breaks.
They did not challenge Clinton's actions in court.
Before the law's enactment in 1996, the president could veto an entire spending measure but not individual items.
The courts will find constitutional.
The line item veto disrupts the balance of powers between the legislative and executive branch.
On Monday, Clinton used the law to veto 38 spending items in a military construction bill.
Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court ).
