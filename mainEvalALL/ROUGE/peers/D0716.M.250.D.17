A fourth uranium mine could be approved within a year after Energy Resources Australia company moved to fast-track for the Jabiluka mine in Kakadu National Park.
The Jabiluka project is considered a litmus test for several other potential uranium mine projects in Australia.
An old car dressed up to look like a frill-necked lizard blocked the entrance to the Jabiluka uranium mine site inside the borders of Kakadu National Park, in September 1998.
She said it represented the animals in the surrounding Kakadu park which would be endangered by the construction of a uranium mine which is expected to extract almost 20 million metric tons of uranium ore over 28 years.
The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed.
A United Nations World Heritage committee called, in November 1998, for the scrapping of the proposed Jabiluka uranium mine in Australia's Northern Territory.
"The mission therefore recommends that the proposal to mine and mill uranium at Jabiluka should not proceed," the committee said in its report following a visit to Kakadu last month.
The Australian government will have until April 15 of next year to try to stop the United Nations from declaring Kakadu National Park endangered because of the Jabiluka uranium mine.
The Australian federal government, in April 1999, rejected a UNESCO report which called for Kakadu National Park in northwest Australia to be placed on the endangered list because of the threat posed by the Jabiluka uranium mine.
