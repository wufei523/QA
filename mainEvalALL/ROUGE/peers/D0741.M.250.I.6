One of the handguns Barton used in the spree, a Colt.45-caliber, was traced to a North Texas gun dealer, police said, and had been registered to another purchaser in 1983.
Barton registered the other, a 9 mm Glock, in 1993.
With the letter and eyewitness accounts of Barton's shooting spree in Atlanta, Mercer said his investigation into the deaths of Leigh Ann Barton and the children is concluded but authorities would continue to search for a motive.
A third gun, a .22-caliber pistol, also was recovered by authorities at the apartment, but the ATF spokesman said it apparently was not involved in this week's shootings.
Two other weapons, an HR .22-caliber pistol that Barton purchased from a South Carolina pawnshop in 1976 and a .25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol that was purchased from a Georgia pawnshop in 1992 by someone else, were found in the van where Barton killed himself, the spokesman said.
Police also found 200 rounds of ammunition in the van.
``They all just started holstering their guns,'' he said.
``I guess they knew he was dead.
