The radical Basque daily Euskadi Informacion said it had received a statement from ETA in which the separatist group announced a truce in its 30-year-old battle for an independent Basque homeland in the north of Spain, the state-run news agency EFE reported.
The group, whose name means Basque Homeland and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in its campaign for a separate homeland in the Basque country, an area which straddles parts of northern Spain and southern France.
ETA reiterated its willingness Monday to open peace negotiations with the government, but fell short of announcing a permanent cease-fire as has been demanded by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
A former leader of the Basque separatist group ETA urged the government Thursday to transfer ETA prisoners to jails inside the Basque country as a first step towards peace talks.
The Spanish government has ruled out any discussion of Basque independence in expected peace talks with the armed separatist group ETA.
Spain said Friday it will move 21 Basque separatist inmates from far-flung prisons to jails closer to their home region, a move seen as a gesture to the armed Basque group ETA.
The government has been under pressure from both hardline and moderate Basque nationalists, and even the mainstream Socialist opposition party, to make a significant gesture to ETA on its long-standing demand that separatist prisoners be transferred to the Basque country.
In late October the government moved four ailing ETA prisoners to the Basque country itself.
