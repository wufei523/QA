The question is whether, through his contact with Goldberg, Porter ended up representing anyone, including Mrs. Tripp, involved in the case who went to the prosecutor's office.
Maryland's wiretapping case against Linda Tripp came to an official end as a Howard County judge dismissed the indictment of the central figure in the impeachment of President Clinton.
That left prosecutors unable to prove that the call took place before Tripp's immunity took effect.
These folks are entitled to their opinion, of course.
It seems like everybody has an opinion about Linda Tripp.
Some of the opinions are favorable.
Tripp was one of the instigators of the situation that is supposedly victimizing her.
With four exclamation points).
She wrote to Tripp.
Tripp was beginning to see Lewinsky's point of view, or so she thought.
Lewinsky also said Tripp urged her not to sign an affidavit in the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit denying both the affair and obtaining presidential assistance in securing a job.
Tripp: ok.
Tripp: Good.
Tripp: Yeah.
In fact, that prospect seems increasingly ludicrous.
Tripp, remains employed by the Pentagon but has worked from home since the Lewinsky affair broke.
It was one of those moments that burrows deep into the memory but readily scurries to the surface whenever we hear the name.
Tripp is a despicable character, to be sure.
On the other side are those who take a dim view of her betrayal of the young woman she befriended and of Kenneth Starr's independent counsel office.
