Ms. Simpson's father, Lou Brown, insisted Tuesday that no custody agreement had been reached and was angry at Simpson's lawyer for talking about the negotiations to The Associated Press.
The professional football Hall of Fame Award that had been presented to Simpson went at auction for $10,000 to representatives of a computer Web site who said they plan to destroy the certificate and some Simpson football jerseys on Wednesday to protest failings in the criminal justice system.
``We are destroying O.J.
Simpson's property in front of the L.A. courthouse because the criminal justice system is destroying justice before our very eyes,'' protest organizer Bob Enyart of Denver said.
Two No. 32 football jerseys and a Professional Football Hall of Fame induction certificate were burned and two trophies were smashed outside the Criminal Courts Building in a protest organized by a Christian radio talk show host who purchased $16,000 worth of items.
The most coveted item and the last to be auctioned was the Heisman Memorial Trophy awarded to Simpson in 1968 when he was a senior at the University of Southern California.
O.J. Simpson's Heisman Memorial Trophy fetched $230,000 at an auction Tuesday intended to raise money for the families of his ex-wife and her friend, Ron Goldman.
The auction Tuesday raised $430,000, including $255,500 for Simpson's Heisman Trophy.
``It's the only Heisman ever to be offered at auction,'' said Michael Schwartz.
The buyer of the Heisman Trophy, an East Coast collector, did not want to be identified.
