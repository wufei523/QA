Turkey's foreign minister on Thursday said the European Union's definition of Turkey as a candidate for membership will pave the way to improved relations between Brussels and Ankara.
``Although wrong assessments by the European Union persist, with the definition of Turkey by the European Commission as one of the 12 candidate countries, the road toward developing our relations has opened,'' Minister Ismail Cem said in a statement.
"Turkey welcomes the reaffirmation of the European Union's 14 members to carry out their obligations toward Turkey within the framework of customs union," the statement said.
-- Turkey tonight accused the European Parliament of voting to block European Union's aid to Turkey.
In what was regarded as an attempt to allay Turkey's concern, Solana said NATO would include Turkey in military operations by the Western European Union, the EU's military body.
Ciller stressed that Turkey had been a NATO member for 46 years and was the only customs union member among the EU, adding that it was impossible to exclude Turkey, which applied for full membership in the Union in 1987, from the expansion process of the EU.
"The customs union continues to have a positive impact in Turkey and on Turkey's trade relations with the EU," he said, referring to the customs union agreement which took effect in 1996.
Turkey had been asking for three decades to join the European Union but its demand was turned away by the European Union in December 1997 that led to a deterioration of bilateral relations.
