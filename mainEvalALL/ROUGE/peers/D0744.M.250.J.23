More than two years after the federal government's first effort to define and regulate organic food failed to win public approval, the Department of Agriculture is announcing much tougher rules that prohibit the use of genetically modified ingredients in products carrying the organic label.
Several advocates of organic farming who have seen the revised rules say that the standards are stricter than those developed in any other country and have set the bar very high for organic farmers in the United States, possibly discouraging rather than encouraging them to grow organic crops.
The national standards could help U.S. producers sell organic food abroad, where there has been substantial opposition to the use of genetically modified crops and other new food technologies.
Some of the nation's biggest food manufacturers are getting into the natural-foods business, including General Mills Inc. and H.J.
Heinz Co.
General Mills has a new organic cereal and announced in December that it was buying Small Planet Foods, a leading producer of organic food products.
The attack on organic food by a well-financed research organization suggests that, even though organic food accounts for only 1 percent of food sales in the country, the conventional food industry is worried.
But as sales grew more than 20 percent a year through the 1990s, organic food came to account for $1 of every $100 spent on food, and in 1997 the agency took notice, proposing national organic standards for all food.
