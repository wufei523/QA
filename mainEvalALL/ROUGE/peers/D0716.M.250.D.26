The Australian branch of the International Council on Monuments and Sites said the impact on archaeological and rock art sites in the region of the mine had not been properly assessed.
In a submission to the U.N. team, which is investigating whether the mine threatens the environmental and cultural values of Kakadu, the council said it was particularly concerned about the Malakunanja 2 archaeological site, just 1.2 miles from the mine entrance.
Australia's first new uranium mine in a decade began.
Police have not said if they suspect a link between the attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
Australian Environment Minister Robert Hill said scientific evidence proved the natural values of Kakadu would not be threatened by the development of the mine.
Located in the Northern Territory, northwest Australia, the Kakadu National Park covers 20,000 square km.
Australian Prime Minister John Howard defended the government's decision to go ahead with uranium mining on development and environmental grounds.
A dozen protesters opposed to the uranium mine chained themselves to the car-lizard about 4 a.m., according to blockade spokeswoman Kerry Nettle.
It said the mine, which could process 19.5 million metric tons of uranium ore could damage the environment.
ERA has identified more than 90,000 tons of uranium oxide at Jabiluka, one of the largest untapped high-grade uranium ore bodies in the world.
