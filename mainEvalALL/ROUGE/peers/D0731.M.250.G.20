The Tripp tapes were the basis for Kenneth Starr's investigation into President Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
WASHINGTON ( AP ) Linda Tripp, whose tape recordings of Monica Lewinsky triggered a criminal investigation of President Bill Clinton, was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury next week, one of Tripp's lawyers said Thursday.
It was Tripp who decided to secretly tape conversations with Lewinsky in which Lewinsky talked about an alleged affair with Clinton.
He is investigating whether Tripp lied when she denied making copies of the tapes which triggered Starr's probe of alleged perjury and obstruction in President Bill Clinton's affair with the intern.
Tripp and New York book agent Lucianne Goldberg who said she urged Tripp to record her conversations with Lewinksy teamed to expose the matter to the media, to independent counsel Ken Starr and to lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
Linda Tripp was a lot easier to take when she was slinking around in Ken Starr's shadow and refusing to comment on his investigation of the president.
Starr's investigation of sex-and-lies allegations involving Clinton and Lewinsky not to mention the accompanying media frenzy directly resulted from Tripp's decision to tape her conversations with Lewinksy.
Word of her scheduled appearance comes as special prosecutor Kenneth Starr tries to negotiate agreement for the cooperation of Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern who alleged in conversations with Tripp a presidential affair and cover-up.
