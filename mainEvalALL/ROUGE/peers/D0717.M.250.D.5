The talks are in the earliest stages, but American Home Products hopes to reach an out-of-court deal in cases scheduled for trial in Texas this spring and summer, said Houston lawyer Graham Hill, whose partners, representing plaintiffs, attended two settlement meetings.
The Dallas Morning News, which first reported the negotiations today, said American Home Products would pay billions of dollars under such a deal.
Through its Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories subsidiary, American Home Products marketed fenfluramine - half of the fen-phen combination - and Redux, a similar product.
NEW YORK - American Home Products has agreed to pay $3.75 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide by people claiming health problems due to the company's once popular fen-phen diet drug combination, the company announced today.
The settlement is open to anyone who used fen-phen and Redux in the United States, whether or not they filed suit, American Home said.
Almost six million Americans took the diet drug combination until it was banned by the Food and Drug Administration in 1997 after reports that some users developed serious, and sometimes fatal, heart problems.
The Linnens and American Home Products settled the lawsuit after it went to trial.
Fenfluramine makes up half of the "fen-phen" combination prescribed to thousands of patients to promote weight loss.
