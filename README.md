OpenEphyra
==========

This repository contains a resurrected and repaired version of OpenEphyra
<https://mu.lti.cs.cmu.edu/trac/Ephyra/wiki/OpenEphyra>. It was branched
from the latest version of OpenEphyra on SoundForge
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/openephyra/>, as of March, 2014, for use
in the OpenCog artificial intelligence system (Copyright (C) 2014
[OpenCog Foundation](http://www.opencog.org/)).

Changes made from the original:
- Removed obsolete KnowledgeMiner classes, which no longer function due to
changes in the various search engine APIs. Google, Bing, and Yahoo all have
since converted to subscription based services, as well as newer technology.
- Replaced the old Bing KnowledgeMiner with a new, functioning Bing Azure
KnowledgeMiner. This KM requires an Azure subscription key:
https://datamarket.azure.com/dataset/bing/searchweb. Currently, there is
a free key available that allows up to 5,000 queries per month.
- Miscelaneous minor fixes and clean-up.

The simplest way to open/build/run OpenEphyra is using Eclipse with the Ant build file feature. In Eclipse, select "File->New->Project->Java->Java project from existing ant buildfile" and choose the existing build.xml file that's in the project root. You can also use OpenEphyra in a sort of "API mode" if you want to call its functions from another app. The instructions for that are explained in the API_MODE.MD file (you still need to build the project first).

The original README file is included below:

Getting Started:
----------------

If you just like to run OpenEphyra in command line mode, try the following:

- Go to the folder 'scripts'.
- Execute OpenEphyra.sh (Unix, Linux, and Mac OS) or OpenEphyra.bat (Windows).
- Type in a factoid question, 'LIST:' followed by a list question, or 'exit'.

The only system requirements are a Java runtime environment (version 1.5 or
later) and about 1 GB of free RAM.
